We had to cancel to one of our friends having to have a back surgery and would no longer be able to travel. This was for a special occasion for him. Airbnb and the host have declined to refund any money. There is no customer service or support. Avoid at all costs.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
2,Airbnb.. worst experience ever overnight,"Was part of the group of 7 people who stayed at this place. Everything about this apartment was a lie, most things broken and not working on the place, smelled like weed, a/c barely working, refrigerator broken, toilets wouldn’t flush, every piece of furniture was broken in some way.  The worst part was that it’s located in the worst part of town, and a very unsafe feeling all around the place.  Could go on for hours about how bad the experience was… 1300 Crossing Place 522Austin, Texas 78741United States of AmericaI will never use an Airbnb ever again in my life.  Can only hope someone will learn from our mistake.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
3,Serious safety issue ignored and case mishandled,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb. During my stay, water leaked directly from the bathroom light fixture for four days in a windowless bathroom, creating a clear risk of fire and electrocution. Despite providing evidence and reporting this immediately, Airbnb treated it as a minor “amenity issue” and offered me just €75 in compensation.Even more troubling, the host pressured me to remove my review in exchange for a refund. I refused, because I wanted to respect Airbnb’s rules and trust their process. Unfortunately, this left me worse off — Airbnb closed my case without taking the safety risk or the host’s misconduct seriously.This experience has completely undermined my trust in Airbnb’s promise to “have guests’ backs.” If safety hazards and review manipulation are brushed aside in this way, it is hard to see how guests can feel protected by the platform.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
4,I recently booked with BRIAN LAMBERT in…,I recently booked with BRIAN LAMBERT in  LENOIR NC and his amenities were not at all what he described. The listing says he has a stove and all he has is a hot plate! That's just one of the many lies he uses to describe this space. We also had ants throughout the entire unit for our stay and he said we brought them with us!!! of course I complained to him and he wrote a review saying I was combative and he does not recommend me to anyone else. I spent hours on the phone and did two request to remove this review and had all of the proof and pictures to support the truth and they denied the removal of the review both times that he did on me! Absolutely ridiculous because I had all of the proof! Won't be using AIRBNB again!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

6,Airbnb allowing hosts extort money from…,"Airbnb allowing hosts extort money from the guests.By mistake I booked an accommodation for 1 person instead of 3. While amending the booking, the host asked 3 times the cost of the apartment. ( 330€ instead of 110€). Normally only extra city tax was to apply. I rejected host’s offer and he cancelled my booking. I lost the money I paid and the host refused me to check in (even alone).Despite of me providing the screenshot of differential I had to pay on this apartment (extra city tax),I was explained by Airbnb that I had to accept the amendment (330€)..I had the impression that all people of Airbnb support were merely bots 🤖",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
7,Avoid at all cost,"Man, the rating on Trustpilot and their stock performance over the last 5 years really speaks for itself.Company loosing it value.Per definition.Honestly, Airbnb has the best UI. But underneath the facade, the company is super ugly.Honestly, I would try to avoid them at all cost.I got blocked because one host wasn't returning my property and kept lying to me that he could not access the apartment, even though I saw the profile was being booked.I told him he will see I will go to the police.Then Airbnb just blocked me without naming any specific reason.Because they support thieves, don't hold them accountable and even support them.Emotionally immature, incompetent company.AVOID AT ALL COST.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
8,Airbnb offers NO real protection,"​Booked an Airbnb for £1,577 (2 nights, 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms). Reality: no hot water for hours, one bathroom unusable all day, tradesmen drilling inside for 5+ hours — with multiple babies in the house.Airbnb’s “Guest Refund Policy” promises protection if essential amenities fail or if the property isn’t as described. All applied, yet they dismissed it as “no violation” and offered a token $200. Only by going through my credit card company did I claw the money back.Airbnb does not protect guests. Their policies mean nothing in practice. Book with extreme caution — you’re on your own if things go wrong.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
9,Airbnb is showing outrageous injustice,"Airbnb is showing outrageous injustice. People from Russia cannot use the service just because they live in Russia. This is pure discrimination based on nationality. Airbnb is depriving a huge group of people of the right to use its platform, to travel freely, and to choose accommodation — following double standards instead of principles of equality and accessibility.Such treatment of customers is absolutely unacceptable in the modern world. Instead of bringing people together, the platform deliberately divides them and punishes them for their origin and place of residence.Airbnb must reconsider this shameful practice, otherwise it will remain branded as a company that violates basic human rights and discriminates on the basis of nationality.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

11,Excellent Customer Services…,"I had to contact Airbnb as my recent trip did not meet my expectations on may levels - the host's problem I may add.  Airbnb handled my concerns with extreme empathy, kept me updated and even called me.  My issue was resolved within 36 hours of me first raising the issue.  I found this style of customer care to be outstanding. Thank you, especially Minhaj & May (Case manager) for really helping me to go from unhappy (due to my trip) to happy. ☺.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,5
12,System Cybersecurity Threat Weaknesses,"My experience with Airbnb highlights failures that raise not only customer service concerns but also potential regulatory and legal exposure.Prior to my stay, the host contacted me through Airbnb’s own platform and attempted to coerce me into providing payment details via an off-platform website under threat of cancellation. The link triggered an immediate phishing/security alert in my browser. When I reported this, Airbnb customer service advised me to “keep trying.” Instructing a consumer to bypass a security warning and reattempt access to a suspected phishing site represents a reckless disregard for data security. This response is inconsistent with basic cybersecurity standards and could place Airbnb in violation of consumer protection and data security obligations under U.S. federal and state law. A former member of Airbnb’s own legal department later acknowledged this as a serious lapse.Following the stay, matters deteriorated further. Weeks after checkout—and beyond Airbnb’s review and dispute window—the host accused me of stealing a spoon and demanded $10. This baseless allegation, unsupported by any timely evidence, was nevertheless entertained by Airbnb. By siding with the host, Airbnb effectively validated a frivolous claim, raising additional concerns about the integrity of its dispute resolution process.Together, these incidents reflect systemic weaknesses in Airbnb’s handling of cybersecurity threats and post-stay disputes. They expose guests to fraud, undermine trust in the platform, and suggest possible breaches of Airbnb’s duty of care and obligations under consumer protection law.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

14,This platform is such a pain to deal with,"I have been using Airbnb for 12 years but so wish there was a good alternative. Customer service is absolutely useless, even harmful. As a guest, I was scammed by hosts and the customer service in fact facilitated that. As a host and guest, I have repeatedly experienced that customer service attendants lack basic reading comprehension to understand and respond to simple questions.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
15,Terrible experience,Terrible experience. We rented and paid well for a home in Rome. We are excellent tenants. I followed up with the host before I posted my review and she thanked us for cleaning the apartment and  being good renters. I gave the host a 5*. Seems the host never finished our review and although I spoke to air bnb which I can post copies of their response that we have 5 rating something on their website had us getting declined without them understanding why. I have asked for their help to correct but only received apologies and less desirable rentals after over an hour of my time. At this point if they don’t make good on correcting I will never use them again for personal or business,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
16,"Unfair, Retaliatory, and Unreliable Company","After 8 years as a loyal Superhost with excellent reviews, Airbnb removed my account the very next day after I emailed their CEO about unfair practices.No warning.No proof.No appeal process.To make matters worse, Airbnb canceled all my guests’ confirmed bookings at the last minute, leaving travelers stranded with nowhere to stay. This is not only unfair to hosts but also deeply unfair to guests who trusted the platform.Airbnb claims to support “community,” but in reality, they bully hosts and abandon guests. If they can do this to an 8-year Superhost, they can do it to anyone.Avoid this platform — it is unsafe for both hosts and travelers.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
17,I’m extremely disappointed with my…,"I’m extremely disappointed with my experience on Airbnb. It feels like the platform consistently prioritizes the host over the guest. Even when issues arise that clearly affect the guest’s stay, Airbnb seems quick to side with the host. In my case, the host left a false or unfair review, and instead of addressing it, Airbnb appeared to support them without proper investigation. Guests should feel protected and heard, but unfortunately, Airbnb seems more interested in defending hosts than ensuring a fair and safe experience for those booking. This bias makes me hesitant to use the platform again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

20,Bad customer service,"We were accused of breaking a table when we stayed with an Airbnb host, even though everything was in order when we left the apartment. The owner contacted us only a week later to say that the table was broken. We tried to appeal to Airbnb that we really didn't do it, but Airbnb didn't even look into the situation and just gave standard answers. It's a really bad feeling when you are accused of something you didn't do and have to pay $250 in compensation. I really didn't expect Airbnb to do this to us. Really very poor customer service.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
21,Award for worst customer service”support”,"This isn’t my (or many people’s) frustrating customer “support” experience with Airbnb! If I could give a negative star every time, I would! I haven’t always written a review for lack of time but this time I am taking the time!Although the Airbnb customer “support” is non-existent” I have been on the platform as I had been at least fortunate to have multiple good hosts!This time unfortunately I had another misfortune of running into a terrible host, who had a terribly unhygienic room and much worse filthy shared bathroom where the other permanent /semi-permanent resident (as the host had mentioned his family might be in that room at times) would not flush the toilet properly every time and leave shaved hair all over the faucet that had to be hosed by me everytime before use!!The terribly dirty room with carpet of ages ago that was full of dust and wasn’t cleaned before arrival, corners full of dirt and dirt, magazine rack with musty mildewey magazines of 1900s!! and I was still patient to have him clean after I arrived… Finally I didn’t want to clean up the xxxx of the resident in the toilet and faucet everyday and I showed photos of all that to Airbnb and they pretty much grilled me for being patient to let the host address in vain and advised to leave right away and offered a refund for the rest of the days!!But the host in spite of sharing photos with both him and Airbnb of all the issues, wrote a retaliatory review for Airbnb enforcing the move, full of lies and aggressive innuendos accusing me that it is a lie (in spite of evidence that Airbnb saw) and me asking to have it cleaned as a “favor” etc. etc. and full of terrible passive aggressive language of innuendos and lies just to protect himself and ruined my perfect 5 star guest status!When mentioned that he is claiming all the evidence as lies and doing false accusations and defamatory language with euphemisms and asked for it to be removed, Airbnb said it is all within their policy that lying isn’t considered against their policy!!!!! in spite of the actual evidence!! Each one kept repeating the same thing like robots in spite of repeatedly you saw the photos, agreed and advised me to leave that place!!It is appalling that a greedy corporation is actually giving full permission for hosts to lie as much as they want (just like them) and there is absolutely no point having evidence in that case ironically the same photos based on which they asked me to leave such terrible place saying I didn’t have to be in such appalling place and the host isn’t responding to their messages as well!I was also told in the community center that the removal of any reviews is handled by AI now and having these addressed is pretty much impossible!!Then I got the same run-around for customer “support” as usual for days dodging this and being handed from one “team” to another until finally a “senior manager” comes up as usual with power to close everything! I also suggest customers never to go to a manager at Airbnb because they have the right to close any case and make things worse for you!Earlier one “manager” from the India team had told me that they cover everything in their legal and there’s no one in Airbnb who would help me (in my previous experience) and at that point I had to contact the exec team for refusing me a host approved refund of thousands of dollars!! So beware before having it escalated! Managers are the most corrupt on Airbnb and they can totally close your case without any consequences!!The only reason I have used Airbnb is for long term stays (due to unfortunate lack of competition although I have been trying to switch any time I have found other long-term options) and also due to many good hosts that are still there, so I request hosts to find other better options to put their listing on so the market isn’t monopolized.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
22,Absolutely disgusted with the customer…,"Absolutely disgusted with the customer service from Airbnb, I unfortunately got scammed into buying £1500 worth of Airbnb vouchers. I completely take the full blame for this however, after being on numerous phone calls with different agents I was told that there was no way they could track the 6 vouchers to any bookings. How they're unable to look and track what accommodation has been booked with vouchers beyond me! I was also told by an agent that they could see from their end that 3 of the bookings were made by users who had used false booking information! Not only am I £1500 down, I'm extremely distraught by this whole experience and was hoping that I could come to Airbnb for some guidance. If they have no tracking system as to who's staying in people's properties, it's safe to say I will not be using them again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
23,Airbnb left me and my daughters on the…,"Airbnb left me and my daughters on the street at night in Jerusalem.Reseña:I booked 10 nights in Jerusalem with Airbnb. After a 20-hour trip with my two daughters, the host denied us entry and refused to let me use the building’s Wi-Fi to pay the required VAT. Instead, he sent an external payment link, which I felt was unsafe and outside Airbnb's policies.We ended up stranded on the street at night with our luggage and young children. Some Airbnb agents initially recognized this as unacceptable and suggested a refund, but the final decision contradicted that—“no rules were broken”—and the offer was only a 10% refund.This wasn’t a VAT dispute. It was a failure to ensure guest safety, trust, and basic human dignity. Airbnb’s resolution was inadequate and unacceptable.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
24,Double Standard By Airbnb,"I accidentally booked a stay for September 7–12 instead of November 7–12.I realized the mistake within 30 minutes and immediately contacted Airbnb. Their own support agent cancelled the booking on my behalf and assured me over the phone that if the host refused a refund, Airbnb would refund me directly.Later, the host promised me in writing that they would refund my September booking if I made a new reservation for November. After that, however, the host changed their cancellation policy and refused to honor this promise.Airbnb then declined to support me, saying “refund is at host’s discretion,” even though I had clear written proof of the host’s initial agreement. They offered me a $200 coupon (on an $800 booking), then closed my case completely.This is extremely disappointing. Guests should not be punished for an honest mistake that was reported immediately. Changing the policy after the fact and refusing to honor written promises is a double standard.I will be pursuing this further with my bank and sharing my experience so that other travelers are warned. Be careful: if something goes wrong, you might lose your money even with written proof.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
25,Business owners be careful,Business owners be careful. Be careful when you change an invoice to a new business address and VAT number. It doesn't get processed and they don't provide you with a new invoice. I accepted that in future it is better to book with another company when I need company expenses. They are completely not willing to help you.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
26,Double dipping charges,"I had a horrible experience in an Airbnb in Streedagh, Sligo. I was charged very high fees, including high fees for 'cleaning'. The host went on to state that I should have cleaned his house, which wasn't that clean to begin with.I go to Sligo regularly to visit family. Thankfully, I have now done some research, and Booking.com offers much better prices and doesn't double dip with cleaning fees.I will definitely go with Booking.com next time.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
27,Warning to Hosts,"Warning to Hosts: Airbnb Sides with Guests on Unverifiable Claims:I host a well-maintained, stylish home in a quiet area, with high standards for cleanliness and preparation. Recently, I’ve encountered guests who fabricate issues, such as odours, wet furniture, or noise -  after arrival, clearly aiming to cancel earlier than previously intended without penalty.Airbnb has consistently sided with these guests, issuing refunds without consulting me or allowing time to inspect the property - even within 24 hours of the complaint. Other hosts report similar experiences, and these tactics are becoming more frequent as Airbnb fail to deliver satisfactory guest experiences also.This has cost me + £2,000 in recent months. Airbnb’s handling of these cases undermines their stated host protections and encourages dishonest behaviour. In my view, it’s no longer a viable platform for reliable hosting.Their big problem in my opinion is a lack of customer support for hosts now and hosts of legitimate properties such as myself will take our properties elsewhere now as the business model is too rocky. Airbnb is too uncertain a service now.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
28,The host always wins,"The host always wins. Falsely advertised property, given access to another occupied flat with personal belongings and deletion of messages. All that taken into account and I never ended up using the property, my review was removed, they were allowed to leave one for me. Air BnB have now asked me to put together a case to prove everything, no proactive checks themselves on deletion and changing of details. So poor, sticking to hotels from now on.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
29,I am a host,"I am a host, and recently I have been battling with Airbnb to resolve a water damage claim against a guest. There is no hope for any resolution. Unfortunately, we as host are in the merci of God, to have a decent guest stay with us. There is ZERO financial reimbursement from Airbnb if the guest refuse to pay. My personal financial loss is greater than what I received from this guest. I opted for short lessee as I needed some extra income to support my daughters college fees. IT WAS NOT WORTH IT! Airbnb claims that the only act as agents and have no obligation to pick up the repair bill if the guest refuse to pay. I as a host have no say in drafting any T&Cs or request a deposit as a guarantee for any damage. So, the hosts are just putting themself in unlimited financial risk with no protection.The Airbnb customer support team are also so useless, They just read their scripted templates and do not understand the core of the complaint.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
30,Booking cancelled and price raised,We booked a home for a 5 night stay in June of 2026. It seemed like the perfect place for our large group. We paid the full price upon booking and thought everything was set. A few days ago we got a message that our reservation had been canceled without any explanation. Included in the message was a list of comparable homes if we wished to rebook. Much to my surprise our original home was included in the list but at an almost $2000 price hike. We were originally told by Airbnb that it was canceled for our protection due to concerns about the host. The host told us that it was a “computer glitch” with pricing and we were charged the wrong amount. After much communication back and forth Airbnb aligned their story with the host and offered us no recourse other than our refund and $160 if we rebooked with them.I don’t understand how they can get away with changing prices after you have faithfully fulfilled your end of the contract. Apparently there are no protections from this kind of activity and people should be made aware of this upfront.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
31,Airbnb processed multiple unauthorized…,"Airbnb processed multiple unauthorized charges on my credit card for reservations I did not make. Despite reporting the fraudulent charges, Airbnb refused to provide assistance unless compelled by subpoena.During this process, they falsely accused me of sharing my card information, which is untrue. Their refusal to cooperate caused significant stress, inconvenience, and wasted time.I urge Airbnb to:1.	Acknowledge that the charges were unauthorized.2.	Refund the full amount.3.	Implement policies to ensure consumers are not forced to obtain subpoenas to access basic transaction details.4.	Issue a public acknowledgment or apology for falsely accusing customers.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

34,Airbnb no protect guest – £800 lost,"I’m extremely disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of my case.On April 9, 2025, I stayed in an apartment in Glasgow booked through Airbnb (Reservation code: HMQJPTR4WM). That same day, I realised I had left a bag with valuable personal belongings (worth approx. £800) in the apartment. I immediately contacted the host via Airbnb messages.The host acknowledged having the bag, even sent a photo of it, and promised to mail it back to me. Since I was no longer in Glasgow, we agreed he would send it via post.Over the next two weeks, he repeatedly told me he would send it ""soon"" — and then suddenly stopped replying altogether. The item was never returned.I reported the case to Airbnb, who escalated it to their insurance partner Crawford TPA. But in the end, nothing was done, and Airbnb took no responsibility, claiming it was “out of their hands.”The host still rents the same flat on Airbnb, despite this unacceptable behavior.Email from Crawford: case #25875038This was a serious failure in guest protection. I lost £800 and got silence from both Airbnb and their insurer. I can’t trust Airbnb anymore — not with my belongings, not with their “host standards,” and certainly not with guest support.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

37,⚠️ Stay Away from Anna’s Property,"⚠️ Stay Away from Anna’s Property – 2527 Jane Street, Pittsburgh, PAI stayed at 2527 Jane Street, Pittsburgh, hosted by Anna, and it was one of the most disgusting and stressful experiences I’ve ever had.As a professional bodybuilder in town for a competition, I spent most of my time resting, cooking, and preparing meals. That’s when I saw it: mice running in broad daylight inside the house, darting from the piano area toward the heating system and into the kitchen. It was so unsettling I had to keep the lights on during the day just to get through the prep. Stress like that before stepping on stage can ruin performance — and it nearly did.If the rodents weren’t enough, the cookware was filthy, burned, and unusable. I had to go out of my way to buy my own pots and pans because hers were simply too nasty to cook with. For a property that charges full price, this is unacceptable.When I raised these issues privately, hoping to resolve it quietly, Anna didn’t apologize or offer to make things right. Instead, she became hostile, made false accusations, and refused to take responsibility.I’ve been using short-term rentals for nearly a decade without a single issue, and this was the first time I experienced something this bad. The house is unsanitary, and the host is unprofessional and defensive.Bottom line: Avoid Anna and avoid 2527 Jane Street, Pittsburgh at all costs. You do not want to deal with the stress, the rodents, or a host who refuses to take accountability.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

They forces us to use the money we paid as credit on airbnb, but there is not even a close option to our initial booking  in any aspect for around the price scale I booked the initial place, and they do not attempt to pay for the only available option which is more expensive then our booking. When I asked them for refunding my money back to my bank account, they asked me to wait for at least 7 days. Yet, I have no other money to book a place via another platform to stay. The only thing they can do is telling me about their standard refund processing time, which is very very clever and customer friendly.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I stayed for 4 hours talking to Airbnb call centre staff before I was finally transferred to a supervisor. When I finally left at 6am the same porter saw me and didn’t say a thing.This has NEVER happened with ANY of the other guests, none of whom are black.Airbnb have a non-discrimination policy but what use is it if there is no transparency in sharing the investigation and its findings and communicating them.They told me the host violated Airbnb guidelines by not communicating with me properly but chose to totally ignore the fact that the porter sent me to the SERVICE ELEVATOR at 2:30 AM!Black people staying in a flat in Palermo with a host, you have been warned!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

That did nothing. We were left with no real support and stuck staying in a property that was disgusting and completely misrepresented compared to the listing.There was service work being done inside the house without us being notified. I woke up with bed bug bites on my arm. There were stains all over the carpet. The kitchen was stocked with only three forks for the entire house. I could go on and on, but the point is this was not remotely what we paid for.Afterwards we left an honest review so other travelers could be warned. Somehow the host was able to have our review removed. So much for Airbnb’s promise of transparency and a trustworthy review system.The message is clear, as long as the host keeps generating revenue Airbnb does not care about the guest experience.

85,"Host in Tournefort, France – discrimination complaint ignored, negative review censored","We stayed at a property in Tournefort, France (July 12–17, 2025), hosted by Dréane Wladimir. What happened to us — and how Airbnb handled it — is something travelers should know.⸻🚩 Our experience with the host:1.	Unreasonable check-in – After a 12-hour drive, we requested a quick check-in. The host insisted on a 30-minute property tour, dismissing our exhaustion.2.	Sexually suggestive conduct – The host engaged in inappropriate poses, including bending over and crawling upstairs on all fours, wiggling her buttocks in front of me. She repeatedly stood too close despite my efforts to keep distance.3.	Disrespectful behavior – She shouted foul language in French as she left, then returned uninvited into our private conversation.4.	Hostility and intimidation – That evening, we overheard a 15-minute aggressive argument between the host and her partner, adding to the feeling of unease.5.	Derogatory messages – She later sent insulting messages, calling me a “weirdo,” and accused me of inappropriate behavior.6.	Privacy violations – She announced she would perform daily property checks, even after we objected, later saying she would only come when our car was gone — making us feel monitored.7.	Inflexibility and pressure – Before arrival, despite warning her about possible delays, she demanded arrival by 7:30 PM, forcing us to leave Stuttgart at 5 AM.8.	Potential retaliation – She offered massage services, and after we declined, her treatment of us became colder and more hostile.We documented these issues in a formal discrimination complaint to Airbnb on August 18, 2025, including explicit details of inappropriate physical proximity, suggestive conduct, aggressive language, and derogatory remarks. Airbnb dismissed the case without informing us of any outcome; the host continues to operate as normal.⸻📝 My original Airbnb review (removed by Airbnb):“We feel compelled to share our concerns about our recent stay. After a 12-hour drive, we requested a brief check-in due to exhaustion, but the 30-minute rundown felt dismissive. Your suggestive behavior, including close proximity and provocative poses, made us very uncomfortable, despite our efforts to maintain distance. Your loud, insulting remarks in French as you left were upsetting. We also overheard a loud argument with your companion, which was unsettling. The daily property checks, even after we raised privacy concerns, felt intrusive, as you noted checking when our car was absent. Your inflexibility regarding our late arrival, despite prior notice due to road issues, added stress, forcing a 05:00 early departure. Lastly, your final message accusing me of acting strangely and calling me a ‘weirdo’ was unwarranted.”Airbnb reinstated this review after my first appeal, but then removed it again two days later, stating it was “irrelevant.”⸻📢 Host’s review of me (still public):“A very intimidating attitude, I greeted him with a smile. He had a very aggressive face, as if he was very, very angry. I think it was inappropriate in front of a woman. I tried to relax things a little by talking but there was nothing to do. Then I showed him how the facilities worked. He continued to act very strangely. It was very disturbing. I tried to communicate with him but either he turned his back on me or he went in another direction. I’ve never been so uncomfortable, he wasn’t acting normally. In 6 years of being a Superhost on Airbnb, I’ve never seen this.”Despite my discrimination complaint and formal requests, Airbnb has allowed this review — filled with insulting, subjective, and gender-based remarks — to remain public.⸻⚖️ Airbnb’s handling:•	My negative review was removed twice (first for being “retaliatory,” later as “irrelevant”).•	The host’s insulting review of me remains public.•	My formal discrimination complaint was dismissed, with no explanation or accountability.•	The host still enjoys 129 perfect 5-star reviews, which is unusual and does not reflect our experience.⸻🚨 Why I am posting this publiclyBecause Airbnb erased my honest review but preserved the host’s insulting one, I feel future guests are not being given the full picture. Guests deserve transparency. Airbnb’s system, in this case, silenced the victim and protected the host.Travelers, please be cautious: the glossy 5-star reviews do not always tell the full story.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I submitted full evidence to Airbnb (photos, cleaning reports, proof of extra guests).Airbnb’s handling of my case was deeply disappointing:They confused my file with another host’s case, referring to a different guest name.One of their agents closed my case without informing me.They falsely claimed I had already spoken to a “specialized team” and received a solution, which never happened.Despite repeated requests, they refused to provide a case-specific written report or explain which policy sections applied. Instead, they replied with generic scripts and finally closed my case, saying their “hands are tied.”This is not only unfair but shows a lack of transparency. As an African host, I cannot avoid the impression that my evidence was disregarded while my UK guest’s position was prioritized.I have now filed formal complaints with the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) regarding misrepresentation, lack of transparency, and unequal treatment.Airbnb markets itself as a platform of “trust and safety,” but my experience proves that when a host faces retaliatory behavior, Airbnb fails to protect us.Hosts, be cautious: even with evidence, you may not be treated fairly.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

96,I have been using AirBnB for a long…,"I have been using AirBnB for a long time. I do enjoy the service. But there are things that, as a business, are unforgivable and easily fixable from their end. I have let them know that several times, and after years, we still have to deal with the same issue; hence, I am rating a 1-star.If I pay via PayPal, the money is instantly in AirBnBs account. I always pay from my Balance, not a credit card. Now, I know that if I refund customers via PayPal, they immediately get a PayPal notification.  So, that alone tells me that you don't even process the refund straight away.I don't care what you do, but when you take a large sum of my money and then have some issues verifying an account that we've been using for over 10 years, and therefore my booking request expires, then you need to find a solution that enables me to book the original or another. You see, not everyone has that same large sum available to make another booking, i.e., they need that money back ASAP.We have been in this same situation several times now over the 10+ years we have been using you. You cockup somehow, or your service provider, but you leave us hanging.  It's unacceptable.Your little henchman on the phone who get paid peanuts, hence, they have no knowledge, and are capable of doing nothing. But if you had some people with a brain, it would be like ""Oh, look, our system has issues because we did away with the Facebook log in; Let's expedite this ID verification; or let's delay this ID verification because we are dealing with a 10-year-old account"".

98,Why won’t you let me give Airbnb 0…,"Why won’t you let me give Airbnb 0 stars???While our condo stay was excellent, my experience with Airbnb as a company was extremely disappointing. The listing was misleading in its pricing — Airbnb displayed a nightly rate of $647 with no separate cleaning fee, while the host’s actual rate was $428/night plus a $140 cleaning fee. That’s about a $700 difference hidden in the way Airbnb structures and presents costs.When I raised the issue, Airbnb repeatedly deflected, closed my case prematurely, and offered only a $150 coupon for a future booking, which felt insulting rather than helpful. Transparency is key, and Airbnb failed to provide it. If these fees and markups were displayed openly, I doubt many customers would accept them — which is precisely why they are not disclosed up front.This was supposed to be a special trip for my mother-in-law’s 75th birthday, and instead, the process left us feeling deceived and dismissed.

100,Awful experience,Awful experience. They cancelled my booking on the day of my holiday and would not give me a reason why (I know it was air bnb who cancelled it and not my host). They then promised to refund my money and provide a refund for up to 3 nights in a hotel at $325 per night per room (up to 2 rooms). I was then able to book the same complex but via the main provider and not air bnb. They said they would only refund me if i could show an invoice. I sent them the booking confirmation which they said i couldnt use because it was an invoice (even though it had on all the information they needed). So i then obtained an invoice in the exact format they requested. They still refused it and questioned if it was valid or not (implying that i was lying). i then proved this by sharing the email with them from the accommodation and they accepted it was a legit document (they didn't apologise for calling me a liar though!). Now their next attempt to get out of paying (even though everything was as they asked on  the invoice). They have been the worst company i have ever had to deal with and i will now be using them again. Cancelled the holiday and then try to wriggle out of paying a refund making it so difficult on purpose. Awful.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
101,Cancelled my booking 3 weeks before I travelled!!! Totally inadequate resolution!,"Airbnb cancelled my booking just three weeks before my holiday, stating the apartment listing I had booked was under investigation due to feedback. They offered alternative options they claimed were “equivalent”, but these were roughly 40 minutes away from where we had originally chosen to stay, lacked the number of bedrooms we originally booked, and didn’t have the same amenities — completely unsuitable and not of the same standard.Since the trip was so close, prices for similar accommodation in the same area had more than doubled. I spent an entire weekend going back and forth with Airbnb, asking if they would cover the difference so we weren’t left out of pocket by hundreds of pounds. They refused, offering only a 20% coupon, which didn’t come close to covering the additional cost.This experience has completely put me, my friends, and others I’ve spoken to off using Airbnb again. Their policy left us without a place to stay and and has forced us to spend significantly more to salvage our holiday — all due to a cancellation that wasn’t our fault. This has caused an inordinate amount of stress ahead of our trip. The customer service team did what they could but management clearly don't care! Luckily, Booking.com has been much more reliable.

105,Unfair treatment and poor dispute resolution – no wonder Airbnb has 1.3 stars,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb that has left me feeling completely let down as a guest.We stayed at a pet-friendly listing and made the host aware in advance that we were bringing small, crate-trained dogs. Unfortunately, during the day while we were upstairs, one of the dogs had a small accident on the bed. We immediately cleaned it thoroughly using supplies provided and were transparent with the host at checkout.Despite our honesty, the host submitted a claim for £120 to replace the duvet, later ""reducing"" it to £80 without explanation. I pointed out that:The dogs were crated overnight (with timestamped photographic evidence),The listing had no house rules prohibiting dogs from being upstairs at the time,The host did not dispute any of the facts when we messaged her directly,The cost was excessive — dry cleaning or a standard replacement would reasonably be under £30.Airbnb ignored all of this and sided with the host. They didn’t address the inconsistencies in her claim or respond to the evidence I submitted. They claimed to be ""neutral,"" yet failed to engage with the clear facts or acknowledge that the host escalated the claim without any justification.I was penalised for being honest, when I could have easily just dry cleaned the item for a fraction of the cost and said nothing.This entire process has felt one-sided and unfair. The lack of transparency, inconsistent standards, and complete disregard for reason is staggering.Given this experience, it’s sadly no surprise that Airbnb has a 1.3 rating on Trustpilot.

108,Unable to deal with issues fairly due to subservience to their 'processes'.,"Writing as a host I have concerns re Air BnB's ability to deal with issues fairly.A guest left me a glowing review, a message saying they had a great time and wanted to return, but only a 3 star overall rating.  I haven't been open long, so one 3 star review in amongst the other 5 star reviews has made a dent in my overall rating, and that matters when you are a small BnB at the very bottom end of the BnB price range.The guest promised to change or delete it, but they didn't. I contacted Air BnB and they sent me a link that they told me the guest could use to delete the review. I sent it to the guest. The guest said that they would do it but a week later nothing had happened.I used Air BnB's review appeal process twice to try and get the rating removed but they refused both times, and then said that as I had used up my permitted two attempts they couldn't do anything further. In between these attempts I telephone them and the person I spoke to assured me that if I requested it deleted again it would be done, but it wasn't.Mean time the guest got back to me saying that the followed the link I sent them and they have looked and looked but couldn't see any way to delete the review.I called Air BnB again, and this time they said that the guest needed to sent them a message asking/authorising them to delete the review - which they could, and should, have told me the first time I contacted them (i'm not sure what the link that they sent me was for).But my issue with them is this... Air BnB's policies and blurb goes on endlessly about the importance of accurate and fair reviews and how the whole system works on the trust of these reviews. In this case no one was claiming that the 3 stars were fair. Air BnB could see my conversation with the guest, they could see that the guest was saying it was a mistake, but they still refused to delete it... so fair reviews are apparently not that important to them after all.I have ME and I have recently reopened, having had to give up my paid job through illness. So the BnB income, although small, is everything to me. This makes me feel lousy every day, but stress, emotional and mental etc, cause me to crash and get much sicker. Each time I have to spend an hour on the phone to Air BnB it causes a crash. So this stuff matters.It's disappointing as previously I have found their customer support people quite helpful, but this time they seem to be at the mercy of their 'processes' and there are no ways to correct mistakes.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2

They then sent 4 booking references without explaining the details, i.e who complained and what the complaint was. They clained that they send me an explanatory email but I never received this. I told them I might have deleted this by mistake but they would not listen and said their decision was final. I tried to contact them again but they then cut off telephone access.

115,Prioritising profits over guest safety,"I had a deeply troubling experience during a recent Airbnb stay. The host was not fully transparent about key aspects of the apartment. After encountering several issues, I requested a partial refund and the host declined, as refunds are at the host’s discretion.More concerning was that the host attempted to enter the apartment without any permission or prior warning, a serious invasion of privacy. I reported this to Airbnb, but they did not deem it a violation of their policies, despite this clearly breaching basic standards of guest safety.Another violation was the host offered me a monetary incentive in exchange for a 5-star review. I reported that as well.I then left a factual, objective review outlining these issues, but Airbnb removed it, stating it was 'retaliatory' as I mentioned that the host declined a partial refund. I suspect that anything you leave in a negative review could be deemed so by Airbnb. This reveals a worrying trend: Airbnb silences honest feedback while protecting hosts who generate income for the platform.This lack of transparency and accountability makes it impossible for future guests to make informed decisions. Reviews should exist to foster trust, ensure safety, and reflect real experiences, and not be filtered to protect revenue.Airbnb appears more concerned with protecting its brand and host income than enforcing its own policies or safeguarding its guests. That completely undermines the integrity of the platform.A company should be judged not just by its policies, but by how it upholds them when issues arise. Airbnb has failed to do that, and has left guests in vulnerable positions with no recourse or protection.I will not use Airbnb again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
116,"Airbnb Failed Again—No Safety, No Accountability, No Dignity","As usual, Airbnb doesn’t protect guests. It abandons them.Here is its latest nonsensical twist: When a host lies about an alleged discrimination, leaving out details about its part in provoking the whole matter , Airbnb doesn’t investigate. They don’t ask for context. They don’t care about truth. They just deactivate your account and move on—no dialogue, no due process, no dignity. PS: I’m still trying to figure out, exactly how does a guest discriminate against a host? I suspect that even Airbnb doesn’t know, just falsely and recklessly throwing around descriptors without a proper context or meaning. I mean, did I somehow withhold something from the host, for a particular reason or favor one host over the next? I know it sounds crazy.Airbnb now strikes again given that in the recent past it demonstrated blatantly that its operation is more about policy—than it’s about safety. Airbnb sends travelers into foreign environments with zero preparation for even the most basic sanitary realities. In some countries, (Philippines) guests are expected to discard used toilet paper in open trash bins rather than flush it. No warning. No guidance. Just weeks of breathing in the fumes of soiled tissue in a sealed room, because Airbnb couldn’t be bothered to flag the health risks or cultural expectations.That’s not just unsanitary—it’s negligent!Airbnb’s support channels are performative. Their policies are rigid to the point of cruelty. And their so-called “community standards” are weaponized against guests who dare to speak up.I wasn’t just mistreated—I was erased. If it think I’m going to remain silent, Airbnb has  got the wrong one.Travelers deserve platforms that prioritize truth, safety, and dignity. Airbnb isn’t one of them.

121,"Airbnb’s Review System Is Broken and Protects Hosts, Not Guests","I had a recent experience with Airbnb that makes me question the integrity of its review system and its commitment to protecting guests.We stayed with a Superhost who claimed to have hosted over 400 guests in 8+ years. Yet, when I checked, she had only 95 reviews, almost all suspiciously glowing. When we left an honest review describing our negative experience, I noticed that Airbnb did not display it at the top (even though it was the most recent) but buried it far below older reviews. This makes the review system misleading and unreliable for future users.Worse, the host responded to our review with defamatory statements, discriminatory remarks, and even disclosed our private information. We reported this to Airbnb support. Shockingly, they told us the only way to remove the host’s malicious response was if we deleted our own honest review. In other words: the host’s harmful, rule-violating content is allowed to stay, but only at the cost of silencing the guest.This shows Airbnb is not committed to transparency or guest safety. Instead, it seems more interested in protecting Superhosts and maximizing bookings rather than maintaining a trustworthy review system. Guests rely on honest reviews to make safe decisions, but Airbnb’s practices deprive them of that right.Airbnb is failing at its core responsibility: providing a fair, safe, and transparent platform.

The noise was from electrical tools which also created dust, e.g. angle grinding work was just one example of some of the noise endured. I have video evidence of the noise as well. The outside space of the property couldn't be enjoyed and windows in the property could not be opened. The issue was raised with the host, MR LanzaroteVillas but they dismissed the problem, stating that ""neighbourhood noise"" is out of their control. The host was certainly aware that the construction site might cause issues as another guest review on a different advertising platform mentions the construction site! That review is dated early June 2025. It's a pity I hadn't seen it before I booked this property and I'd have known that I wouldn't get what the host advertised and what I paid  for i.e. calm, peace and quiet. What I got was loud construction noise from morning to night fir 5 days. The construction is far from completed and so noise is likely to be a feature at this property for another number of months.

128,I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user, but this was by far my worst experience.The property was advertised as “luxury living,” but what I arrived to after an 11-hour flight was extremely disappointing: stained and matted carpets, damaged furniture, grease build-up in the kitchen, dirty and chipped surfaces, grime in the bathroom, and ripped communal loungers. The BBQ listed was there, but dirty, rusty, and unusable. To make matters worse, I found a cockroach inside the property. I documented everything with photos.I contacted the host right away, who pushed me off to a property manager. Instead of offering a resolution, they only suggested coming by the next morning to “inspect,” even though the place was clearly unfit to stay in that night.Airbnb support was even worse. I was verbally told I’d be refunded, but no one would give me confirmation in writing. I was passed between different agents repeating the same lines, waiting on callbacks that never came. The only time I saw actual movement on my case was when I said I would file a chargeback — not as an empty threat, but because Airbnb were ignoring me.Meanwhile, the host tried to pressure me into cancelling the booking myself (which would have been a trap, as it shifts responsibility onto the guest). They also tried to extort me for the first night’s fee plus a cleaning fee, simply because Airbnb failed to act quickly and the issue spilled into the next day.All of this was happening while I had already spent over $6,000 on this booking. Airbnb’s solution? Refunds that take up to 10 working days to process, and a “contribution” of $200 toward alternative accommodation — nowhere near enough to cover the cost of rebooking last-minute in LA. They offered no financial help in the moment, leaving me to cover hotel costs out of pocket.This was stressful, exhausting, and completely unworthy of the trust I placed in Airbnb.

When I explained that certainty was important, the host escalated into hostility, writing “Excuse me,” “this is not your commercial hotel,” “you are not welcome,” and “we don’t need or want your money.”Airbnb initially recorded this as a host cancellation, which would have allowed me to leave a review and warned future guests. Then it was quietly reclassified as “Airbnb cancelled.” That change erased the host’s accountability, blocked my ability to review, and misled future guests.Airbnb talks about trust and transparency, yet their system shields hosts who misrepresent listings and mistreat guests, while silencing those of us who pay in good faith.

This all ended last November 2024, when unexpectedly my account was removed!“Your account will be removed from Airbnb because your account is closely associated with a person who isn’t allowed to use Airbnb. This means you can no longer use Airbnb to travel or host.”I appealed this using their online form and was told I would hear within seven days as to whether or not it was accepted. I never heard back.So I called regularly the customer service number, and every time they simply told me they were not able to give me any reason for my cancellation. They said my issue was to be escalated and investigated by a separate committee. I still never heard back.In January 2025, I sent the headquarters in San Francisco a return receipt letter, once again asking for some explanation. I got my card back, so I know they received it, but they never responded to my letter.Just a few weeks ago, I decided to give them one more call, and was told the same thing. “I’m sorry we can’t give you any information because we don’t have it to give.”This is really troubling, but looking at some of the other reviews, it’s clear that this company has some serious issues. (And I haven’t seen them respond to any of the many complaints!). I’ve actually been very happy staying in hotels since then, as it really is a much smoother process to be very honest.It just bothers me, however, that this company would treat its good customers in this manner.

My stay was deeply disappointing due to multiple safety and cleanliness issues, including broken blinds, sticky surfaces, large couch stains, and a loud AC that disrupted sleep. The deadbolt near the garage failed one night, and as two women traveling alone, we felt unsafe. The host was unresponsive for hours, and the lock was never fixed during our stay.We later discovered that the unit(along with the hosts other listings) are not legally permitted to operate as a short-term rental, violating local ordinances. Despite these serious concerns, Airbnb refused to issue a full refund and removed our honest review under false pretenses.

While they offered a partial refund for only the first night, the issues persisted throughout our stay, and I was advised to leave the property rather than being fully supported as a guest.I am disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of this situation.

The landlord insisted that we clean the place ourselves, which we did to the best of our ability considering our young children.Despite this, the landlord left a false and defamatory negative review accusing us of not cleaning properly. We submitted a formal complaint to Airbnb requesting the removal of this unjust review, providing extensive evidence including a 20-minute video clearly showing the condition of the property before and after our cleaning efforts.To our shock, Airbnb dismissed our complaint in less than 20 minutes without properly reviewing or even watching the videos we submitted. This shows a concerning lack of fairness and transparency in how Airbnb handles review disputes.False negative reviews like this can seriously damage guests’ reputations unjustly, and when evidence is ignored, it undermines trust in Airbnb’s review process. As families traveling with babies and infants, we found this treatment especially distressing.We expected much better accountability and responsiveness from a global platform. If you are traveling with young children, be cautious — even strong evidence may not guarantee fair treatment by Airbnb’s review moderation system.We are now taking steps to escalate this complaint to Swedish consumer authorities and European consumer protection bodies because Airbnb has failed to properly address our case.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

In that time, I tolerated the occasional misrepresentation, but this recent experience crossed a line.I booked a property in La Jolla for $5,400 (four nights). Upon arrival, we found deck railings rusted and coming loose over a steep cliff, plus an interior in deteriorated condition. Clearly unsafe and not as advertised. We reported this immediately.Airbnb first promised resolution “within the hour,” but after 4.5 hours of silence their official response was that the host would paint the railings tomorrow and offer us a discount if we stayed. Painting over a structural hazard the next day is not a remedy. We had already vacated for safety.Airbnb’s “senior case manager” later denied the refund altogether, dismissing the hazard as “wear and tear.” The company’s own policy claims to protect guests in cases of safety hazards or misrepresentation, but in practice it failed completely.After more than ten years of trust, this showed me the company no longer prioritizes guest safety, fairness, or retention. Looking at Airbnb’s 1.3 Trustpilot rating and daily new 1-star reviews, it’s clear my experience is not unique.Airbnb is financially strong and busy expanding into new services, but it seems to have abandoned the basics: delivering safe, honest accommodations and standing behind its own guarantees.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Their only “solution”? Cancel the booking and issue a refund that takes 5–10 days to appear—forcing us to pay again out of pocket just to find somewhere to stay.Because Airbnb would not respond, we had to book a new apartment ourselves on their platform. Only after we informed them that we had already booked did they suddenly say they “could have offered a coupon covering the full stay.” In other words: they stayed silent while we were stranded, and the moment we resolved it on our own, they told us it was too late and that now they “couldn’t do anything.” They refused to cover the new booking, offering only the refund of the original one.We lost two full days of our trip dealing with this nightmare, spent far more money than planned, and received zero real assistance.Airbnb claims to provide security for travelers, but in reality they abandon you when things go wrong and hide behind excuses.

What followed was a nightmare.The agency forced her out, threatened her, illegally entered the property against police warnings, and even stole some of her belongings. I witnessed the entire incident firsthand.Naturally, we expected Airbnb to step in, protect the guest, and take action against such blatant misconduct. Instead, Airbnb did the opposite:They ignored clear evidence of criminal behavior.They seemed to shield the agency rather than the victim.And when I protested, Airbnb’s response was to cancel my account entirely.So not only was I pulled into a criminal case — I was also silenced and punished by the very platform that facilitated the abuse.Having spent over 30 years in investment banking and hospitality, and as the owner of several establishments across Europe, I have worked with countless property owners who currently list on Airbnb. After this experience, I am considering encouraging them to rethink their partnership with a platform that protects revenues over ethics and covers up criminal acts.Airbnb brands itself as a “trusted community.” My story shows otherwise: when things go wrong, victims are abandoned, silenced, and erased.This is not just a bad customer service story.

177,Do not expect help from airbnb support and do not go to Varna Heart Studio,I had very bad experience in my Airbnb location in varna and i did not get any help from Airbnb instead they put me on speaker and laugh at my frustration.We went to our airbnb appartment which was on the last floor and the air conditioner did not work. There was also only one small window that we can open and no elavator. We have to leave the studio at 11:10 p.m pm when i finally found somewhere to stay with my mom(76 years old with heart problems) and my daughter (6 years old). Instead to help me they have sabotage me to find another place thinking probably that we will stay there if we do not find  a place to stay. The owner sent a technician who entered the appartement while we were in front of the building but our luggage was inside without having our permission to go in. At the end i was so exhausted and frustrated they put me on speaker and start laughing at me and my frustration.It is not first time when an airbnb location does not have air conditioner or actually it has but it does not work and it is very hot outside and inside as well. They make also impossible for me to make a review. So i am done with using airbnb.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Even as a Superhost, when you call about an issue with a guest — including security concerns — they will just keep calling you back without actually resolving anything. Even if you send all the justifications, they will keep changing the support person one after another, but never bring a real solution.They drain your time and energy, and you should not expect any reasonable resolution. This is the worst application I’ve ever seen — quick to take their commission, but the last to care about customer service. Worst, worst, worst service I’ve ever experienced in my life.I also want to mention Wennie F. — I truly hope the managers will review her performance and the way she speaks to hosts.

197,Air B N B Services Is Very Difficult To Work With,"As a new host for Air B N B services, the process to get approved has been excruciatingly frustrating.  I own a brick and mortar spa that is rated 5 stars on Google and has been open 5 years.  In May 2025, I submitted my business to Airbnb services. Since then I have received first AI generated information saying that I had to change the listing. They gave me very little information about what needed to be changed. After making the edits and submitting them it took nearly 2 months to get the edits approved. In fact, I am still waiting for the approval process. I’ve had to have meetings with their associates, and even after that meeting and asking for them to not include my personal name in the listing they still provided me back copy 10 days later of my personal name included in the listing. I’ve explained to them several times that it should not take three months to get a listing approved. it is ironic that it is so easy for a host to put up a property and they barely verify it, yet you have to go through scrutinizing approval to get an Airbnb services listing. At this time, I would not recommend other businesses to work with Airbnb services because it will take so much of your time and resources, and they will continue to leave you in the dark about what is happening. If you’re listing finally gets approved, it could take over 90 days to do so. And then, of course I don’t even know what to expect once the listing is approved.

The room I was given was completely different from the listing—photos were misleading, and the space was dirty, old, with unclean walls and bathroom. Despite reporting these issues, I received very little support from the customer service, which responded slowly. After reporting the false advertisement, I was asked by the host to move out, and customer services didn't provide alternative accommodation. Only a fraction of my money was refunded. It appears this listing has been falsely advertising for a long time, which is unacceptable.This kind of behaviour should be penalised, and customers need to raise awareness and report such misconduct. Unfortunately, many are deterred from complaining because Airbnb’s response often discourages genuine resolution, leading to unprofessional service. Over time, I’ve noticed prices on this platform keep increasing, yet the standards of service for guests have not improved—this is disappointing and needs to change. Platforms like Airbnb need to ensure accuracy in listings and offer guests proper support when things go wrong. Based on this experience, I will no longer use this site for my stays and encourage others to be safe and use hotels as a better option, offering quality and reliable service.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
202,Beware of Scammer guests using Airbnb to expoit Hosts,"I have been a highly rated Airbnb host for years, maintaining a spotless record and consistently meeting Airbnb’s hosting standards. My experience with a guest named Frieda, however, revealed a serious flaw in Airbnb’s policies that allows dishonest guests to exploit hosts.Frieda booked a one-week stay starting 27 July 2025. She was informed well in advance that another guest would also be present, as the listing clearly stated. She arrived several hours late without notice or apology. Within hours of arrival, she began making completely unfounded allegations — including false claims about the property’s cleanliness — despite the flat being thoroughly cleaned with dated photo evidence. She even fabricated extreme statements to create the impression of being unsafe.It quickly became apparent this was not a genuine complaint but an attempt to obtain money in exchange for retracting or softening her review. This kind of conduct violates multiple sections of Airbnb’s review and extortion policies, which prohibit using reviews to pressure hosts for refunds. Yet the system allowed her defamatory statements to remain published and when i tried to get this defamatory review removed, Airbnb said there was nothing they could do.The review she left is not only false but abusive and personally damaging, causing moral and financial distress . Airbnb’s current enforcement process fails to protect hosts from guests who weaponise the review system to secure unearned refunds.I would strongly caution any host about accepting a booking from this guest named Frieda.More broadly, I urge Airbnb to take a stronger stance in enforcing its own policies against dishonest, abusive guests who exploit the review process for personal gain.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

After their stay, I left them an honest 1-star review because they caused significant damage to the apartment. I also filed a reimbursement request through Airbnb.In retaliation, the guest left me a 1-star review on a separate 1-day reservation (which occurred immediately after the 32-day stay) — using the exact same damage that I reported as their “reason.” This is a textbook example of a retaliatory review, which is explicitly prohibited by Airbnb’s Review Policy.Despite multiple messages to Airbnb support, quoting their own policy, and submitting formal feedback, the company refused to remove the review and didn’t provide a valid reason. They also refused to escalate the case to a senior case manager or Trust & Safety.As a host, this undermines my trust in the platform. Reviews are supposed to reflect real experiences — not be used as revenge when a host seeks reimbursement for damages.

Naturally, the guest cancelled. All of this could have been avoided if the rep had simply followed instructions. I spent over 2.5 hours on the phone trying to fix their mistake and still got nowhere.Airbnb keeps outsourcing support to overseas call centres where communication is inconsistent and accountability is nonexistent. This isn’t about nationality — it’s about basic professionalism and training. If Amazon can provide fast, competent customer service, so can Airbnb.

The host denied any issue. She suggested maybe it's a dead rat in the walls (?!), apologized for the inconvenience and said we could move upstairs. Upstairs didn't have a proper bathroom or bedroom. Also, we did not paid $4000 for 11 days to stay at half of the apartment.Later, we discovered a large mold spot (about 2x2 feet) hidden behind a panel. Hosts knew about it, they just hid it. And lied even when were asked directly.We then contacted Airbnb support because host's ""resolution"" wasn't suitable nor staying the place was healthy or safe. The smell was itching our throats, it was terrible. Airbnb advised us to leave due to the health risk and promised a refund and protection from retaliatory reviews. We moved out, booked a hotel, and found a new Airbnb. This was a huge inconvenience, loss of money and time.Sure enough, the host left us a 3-star review (while we stayed at her place only 1 night), and Airbnb refused to remove it - even though we followed all their instructions.

230,AirBnB supports and uplifts negligent hosts with bed bug infested establishments.,"I booked the AirBnB ""Townhome in Anchorage"" located on 2121 Lore Rd #2; the dates I booked were 18 Jun 2025 - 1 Aug 2025. Upon arrival on 18 Jun, there were no immediate issues but I started to get bug bites. At first, I assumed it was the local mosquitos but upon inspection of the mattress I became concerned that there was a bed bug infestation. The evening of 16 Jul, I immediately contacted the AirBnB host and AirBnB support. The host and AirBnB received documentation of what I believed to be bed bugs, as well as extensive pictures of the bites on my body. The host coordinated local pest control to treat the AirBnB on 18 Jul. After the chemical treatment, I spoke to the pest control rep and he confirmed that a second treatment is needed, and I should get a report that the AirBnB is truly bed bug free before I sleep on the bed. They also confirmed that the earliest a re-inspection could occur is 25 Jul. The host sent me the official pest control report, which noted that the bed bugs had been there months before my arrival, and that a second treatment is needed on 1 Aug at the earliest. I expressed same day I did NOT want to stay in this AirBnB and be forced to live out of bags, sleeping on a couch or my car, etc. I was eventually able to get out of that AirBnB the evening of 21 Jul because the hotel I booked on 19 Jul was uninhabitable. I was reimbursed for the nights I did not stay at this AirBnB, and the hosts/AirBnB pocketed full cost of the days I spent in the bed-bug infested AirBnB. On 26 Jul, I checked the listing and it was being advertised for dates before 1 Aug 25. I elevated my concerns to AirBnB and they confirmed it was an active listing, and simply ""assured"" me they ""have a detailed report of the bed bug issue [I] experience and [their] team is working with the host to take care of it.""

The platform’s refusal to take responsibility or offer timely resolution exposes a fundamental flaw: a system that allows hosts to cancel post-arrival without consequence, while leaving guests vulnerable.Despite multiple attempts to escalate the issue, Airbnb failed to acknowledge the breach of contract and the clear violation of their customer care standards. Their evasiveness and reliance on generic messaging demonstrate a disregard for user experience and consumer protection.This experience raises serious questions about Airbnb’s reliability, enforcement of its own terms, and the ethical treatment of guests.

He refused and later re-listed the property at a lower price. Airbnb told me the host kept the difference, and they could not do anything because the cancellation was considered to be “on my behalf”—even though it was triggered by their system, not by me.Airbnb ignored my requests for fairness and accountability. Their senior manager offered me only a $100 AUD coupon and closed the case, despite my repeated attempts to explain and find a middle ground.Meanwhile, I lost over $600 AUD, even though I did everything I could to fix the issue in time.

To my surprise, I was told the listing had already been booked by someone else earlier that morning. This left me completely confused and frustrated, as I had every reason to believe the listing was being held for me until the agreed-upon deadline.Still, I remained polite and pointed out that the pre-approval email gave me until 9:30 PM to book. I explained that I simply needed time to coordinate with my family. The host and co-host read my message but never responded. Not acknowledging a reasonable concern, especially after clear communication and a commitment, is not just unprofessional — it’s disrespectful. It made me feel like my time and intentions were dismissed entirely. It also gave the impression that the hosts were more interested in securing a quicker booking than honoring their word or treating potential guests with basic courtesy.To make matters worse, when I tried to report the situation to Airbnb, I couldn’t find a straightforward way to leave feedback through the app. I contacted support and had to jump through several hoops just to explain the situation. One of the agents kept misunderstanding me and confused my issue with a past reservation that had no relevance at all.

There was no clear warning or confirmation step indicating I would lose the full amount. The cancellation felt like a normal process, until I realized I had just lost 100% of my payment.Airbnb should make it much clearer when a reservation is non-refundable, either by blocking cancellation or requiring a confirmation that explicitly states the consequences. Right now, the process feels misleading and unfair to users.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
261,Subject: Immediate Action Required – Ongoing Withholding of Payments Without Justification,"As of today, Airbnb has once again suspended our payouts without providing any explanation or legitimate reason. This marks the fourth time in 2025 that your platform has taken unilateral and unjustified action to block our earnings.We have complied with every request, verified our banking details multiple times, and responded in good faith—yet you continue to hold our funds hostage, severely damaging our operational capabilities. Our suppliers, staff, and business partners will now face delays in their payments, solely due to Airbnb’s arbitrary actions.This is no longer an internal support issue. It is a serious violation of financial ethics and trust, and we will not remain silent.Please be informed of the following:We are preparing a public campaign via social media, directly tagging and informing the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Ministry of Trade, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK), and CİMER.Our legal counsel has been instructed to initiate proceedings regarding Airbnb’s repeated and unjustified withholding of funds from a registered Turkish business.We demand the immediate release of all funds owed to us, and a written explanation for the repeated payout suspensions.Airbnb is profiting from its Turkish hosts while showing blatant disregard for financial transparency and accountability.

266,Avoid Airbnb and Valhalla View,"Booked a 5* 2 night stay in Valhalla View, Scarsferry, Scotland.  Pictures looked amazing and it cost us just shy of £1000 for 2 nights. When we arrived at the property, the house itself looked impressive,  but it was surrounded by what can only be described as a junk yard. On closer inspection the property had not been cleaned.  Windows were filthy, surfaces covered in fingerprints, dirty laundry basket full to the brim. Dirty robe hung on the door, bleach stained towels, dirty floors. Outside there were nesting birds in the roof that had created a large pile of excrement. The grass was waist hight, so the view from the hot tub was long grass to the front, a broken down van to the left and bird poop behind. I could go on, but you get the point. I wrote to the host who made no apology.  He told me it was my choice if I looked at the van. That he could not remove the nesting birds and the long grass was assisting the wildlife... no mention of the appalling cleaning or removal of bird droppings. He did offer a full refund if I left the property,  but I'm 6 hours from home at this stage, with no chance of making a reservation in the Highlands in the hight of summer.  I informed him I would rather stay, but an apology would have helped and some form of reimbursement. I heard nothing back from the host directly.  Around an hour later I received a phone call from Airbnb. The operator informed me the host would like to cancel my booking and asked I leave the property.  I explained all of the above and asked what his justification was in asking me to leave. Apparently you are not allowed to offend a host by giving them accurate feedback of a property.  The airbnb call advisor said he would speak to the host and get back to me. When I received a further call we were given ""permission"" to stay.  On return from our trip I made contact with the support team to discuss the matter further and report this listing as inaccurate. I provided multiple photographs of the issue and was told they would investigate.  I was then informed that none of this violated airbnb's standards and they would not refund anything and I would have to contact the host again, if I wished to take any further action. When the host has already been unreasonable and taken no accountability, how can that even be an option! I spent the entire time i was there, worried he was going to come by the property and try to remove us again. It totally ruined our trip and anniversary. Airbnb should have investigated the matter when the host initially contacted them, and told him he had no grounds to remove us. I did not want to stay after the way we were treated and the state of the property,  but I had no choice!

My son and I arrived at our rental in Fort Lauderdale by the sea, after barely sleeping the night before, expecting to check in at the scheduled time (3:00 PM). The host first offered early check-in for $25, but then told us—after we were already on site—that we couldn’t even check in at the regular time because the cleaning crew wasn’t available. We were told we’d have to wait until 4 or even 6 PM.Airbnb support's solution? “Leave your luggage and go eat,” offering a $50 reimbursement — but we had nowhere to go, and we were exhausted. When we finally got in, the apartment had clearly been “cleaned” in 20 minutes or less. It was dirty, extremely dated, the sofa was stained and uncomfortable, and it looked nothing like the photos.There were no basic amenities — no welcome water, no beach chairs or umbrella (just some towels), and no space to dry wet clothes. This is not what we paid for. Airbnb’s support felt scripted and unhelpful — no real resolution, just “wait and deal with it.” I feel completely let down and will think twice before booking with Airbnb again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

275,A Disappointing Experience Made Worse by Airbnb’s Lack of Accountability,"I have been a loyal Airbnb user for years, both as a guest and a former host, but this most recent experience left me deeply disappointed. It was not just the host’s lack of empathy that hurt, but Airbnb’s refusal to take responsibility or provide any transparency.Shortly after making a reservation, I experienced a death in my family. I contacted the host within 30 minutes of booking, politely asking if they would consider a partial or full refund due to the circumstances. The host declined, and Airbnb advised me to work with them directly. The situation quickly became even more frustrating, with the host showing no compassion and Airbnb refusing to assist beyond repeating policy.Later, I left a respectful and honest review of my experience, which Airbnb removed without explanation. I reached out multiple times to ask what specific policy I had violated. Every time, Airbnb refused to clarify and stated only that the decision was final and they would disengage from further discussion.Even now, I have received no clear answers or real support. I filed a formal complaint through the BBB, and Airbnb responded with a vague, generic message that failed to address my specific concerns. After reviewing other customer complaints, it became clear that Airbnb is simply copy-pasting the same response across multiple cases, regardless of the issue. This lack of personalized or sincere engagement is unacceptable for a platform that claims to value its community.If Airbnb deletes reviews that reflect poorly on hosts, even during personal emergencies, how can travelers trust that the platform is truly transparent or reliable?This is not just about a refund. It is about basic decency, honest customer service, and consumer protection. Airbnb failed on all of those fronts.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

277,"If anything goes wrong, no one will help you in any way","I am 23 years old. I don’t often use air bnb as have always used booking.com / hostelworld when travelling. My family bought a boat from our extended family a few years ago but haven’t had time to restore it. It is VERY old and is pretty much in bits. Me and my boyfriend came out for a month to begin deep cleaning it to help speed up the process as my dad is in the middle of retiring and is going to start coming out now to fix it up. After 2 weeks we found many issues with the boat and had to get someone out to repair it for a few days. We are staying in a small beach village with little apartments etc so we booked with air bnb as more options in a closer town for 2 people and our first stay was perfect. We had to book an additional night somewhere the day before as went on a day longer than expected. I explained the situation and they accepted through text. Then they started saying i had to rebook it as I hadn’t completed it - when in actuality the host hadn’t confirmed the booking through the system. Eventually they realised their mistake after back and forth in which i was very respectful / responsive as i don’t often use air bnb so wanted to know how to do it and thought initially it was my mistake. They didn’t acknowledge their mistake after it was confirmed and just started sending the usual copy and paste of all the details. I thought it was fine - I didn’t leave a review as i thought maybe there was a language barrier and the host didn’t mean to come off rude although i guess deep down i did have a bad taste in my mouth. We stayed for 1 night and left the place spotless as we didn’t eat or really spend any time there. We just used it for a bed for the night. The host left a review saying how young I was (Claire is very young!!!) and she thought my “strategy of getting a boat repaired 10 km away from us is very very strange” and “she didn’t understand it”. I contacted airbnb with absolutely no help or resolution. This may sound silly but i don’t understand why it appears that people are protected on this app. What i have learned about airbnb in comparison to other providers is that they will DO nothing to help you if something goes wrong - when things go fine, great but if ANYTHING and i mean ANYTHING goes wrong - that is it. Why can people (host or guests) leave a review with nothing to do with someone’s stay especially in such a negative way ? Now that will effect if i wanted to book other properties on the app and for what? She left other comments that can’t be accessed in my review just through my profile - special thanks as neat and tidy as well other suggestions try to communicate in a helpful way? We caused no issues and while communicating i was in no way passive aggressive, i was extremely open and respectful as I was just unsure how to fix the problem. I sent in my passport etc before- I have no problem with being 23 and I wasn’t hiding it. It honestly is a service that doesn’t seem to protect anyone- guest or host. I deleted my account as I do not want to support a company that allows such untrue, unprofessional and unsolicited reviews.

305,@airbnbhelp,"Missing payoutsHello fellow Airbnb hosts,I’m reaching out to the community because I’ve been struggling with an ongoing issue that I suspect many of you may have experienced as well. Despite multiple stays being completed, I still haven’t received several payouts that are over a month overdue.Here’s what’s happened so far:I’ve contacted Airbnb Support multiple times, but the responses have been generic, with no real resolution.I’ve confirmed that my payout method (bank/PayPal) is correct and functioning—no issues on my end.After researching online, I’ve seen numerous reports from other hosts who’ve faced similar delays, with some waiting up to 6 months (!) for their funds.Questions for the Community:Is anyone else currently experiencing delayed payouts? If so, how long have you been waiting?Has anyone found a way to escalate this successfully? Did calling support, filing a complaint, or reaching out on social media help?Are there any Airbnb reps in this group who can assist? This seems like a widespread issue that needs urgent attention.I’m deeply concerned because, like many of you, I rely on these payouts to cover expenses. Airbnb’s lack of transparency and resolution is unacceptable.If you’ve been through this before and have advice, please share your experience below. The more we raise awareness, the more pressure Airbnb will face to fix this.Thank you in advance for your help—let’s support each other in getting this resolved!#MissingPayouts #AirbnbHostProblems #PaymentDelays",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

308,I stayed at an Airbnb in Nice,"I stayed at an Airbnb in Nice, France, and was forced to leave early due to a cockroach infestation in the unit. I only stayed 3 out of the 7 nights I paid for. The issue was reported immediately, and I provided photo documentation. The hosts sent a technician but did not resolve the problem—and ultimately ignored all my messages after I left. I received no refund, no compensation, and no accountability. Airbnb offered me only a small monetary amount as a token of goodwill.I wrote a factual and respectful review, but Airbnb removed it, citing a “coercion” policy. Why? Because I had asked the host one last time to issue a refund before I posted it—something Airbnb’s own guidelines say guests should try to do. I did everything right, and still ended up silenced.Airbnb’s support of hosts who ignore safety issues while punishing guests for speaking up is incredibly disappointing. I’m now filing a chargeback and escalating through consumer protection.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
309,"Misrepresented Airbnb, Zero Accountability — PayPal No Help Either","I never leave bad reviews, but I need to warn others about my experience with both Airbnb and PayPal.I booked a $4,200 Airbnb for a group of 8, traveling from across the U.S. and Ireland to bury my mom, dad, and sister. This was a painful, emotional trip, and I proactively reached out to the host before booking to ensure the home was appropriate.What we arrived to was shocking:•	Used band-aids and pimple patches in bedrooms and stuck to walls•	Food under the couch, leading to an ant infestation•	A sandy, moldy, dirty, and unprepared property•	A non-functioning refrigerator•	Broken furniture, torn table coverings, and missing beach amenities that were promised•	The house wasn’t even ready until nearly 7 PM on check-in dayWe immediately contacted Airbnb. I spent over a week, three live calls, and more than 25 messages trying to resolve this. Airbnb admitted they could not override the host’s decision and offered no refund beyond the cleaning fee — even though their own Guest Refund Policy clearly covers misrepresentation and unsanitary conditions.So I turned to PayPal, thinking their Buyer Protection would help. Despite submitting extensive documentation and photos, they denied the claim, saying the “item was materially similar to the listing.” How is a filthy, unsafe, pest-ridden home with a broken fridge similar to the polished listing photos?We couldn’t “just leave” — we were on a small island, with no alternatives, trying to mourn our family members. We made every good-faith effort to resolve this privately. Neither company upheld their own standards or protections.If you’re thinking Airbnb or PayPal will protect you when things go wrong — think again. We were left with the emotional and financial fallout, while both companies passed the buck.Do better.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
310,I wish I could give this review zero…,"I wish I could give this review zero stars, because that's all AirBnB is worth. Recently I used AirBnB for a stay while I finished the purchase of my own place. Unfortunately I am disabled and once my host and roommates learned of my disability, I suddenly became a target and a scapegoat for all the problems the AirBnB was having. None of which there was any proof, but the stereotypical accusation became, ""He is disabled, so obviously he did it"". As a result, this host began wrongly demanding money from me. So, not wanting to be part of such a harsh, discriminate, toxic environment, I ended my stay at this AirBnB a week early. While living at a hotel, these past few weeks, has been a bit more expensive, I at least am living under a more friendly, accepting roof. Also, this host and AirBnB have refused to refund me the money for the unused seven nights of my last AirBnB stay. This host is also the third AirBnB host who has treated me like absolute garbage, has permitted or participated in discriminatory behaviors connected to my disability and has tried to scam money from me, with this last host being the worst of all. I will never use AirBnB again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

For example, in the center of the living room, there was a disturbing poster of a dissected chicken, while the listing photo showed a neutral image. This misrepresentation felt deliberate.The host controlled key handover rigidly – I wasn’t allowed to pick up the keys at a convenient time. She insisted on meeting me at a fixed hour and greeted me with a list of house rules in a cold, directive manner.I spent time writing a truthful, respectful review to help future guests—but Airbnb removed it, claiming a vague ""policy violation"" and refuses to let me write another.

316,Disappointed in Airbnb’s Handling of a…,"Disappointed in Airbnb’s Handling of a Serious Sanitation IssueI recently stayed at an Airbnb rental in Charlotte, NC for a work trip. On the third morning of our four-day stay, we discovered adult cockroaches in the unit. We immediately contacted our host, who unfortunately failed to offer a proper resolution.Following Airbnb’s policy, we escalated the issue to Airbnb Support. After multiple conversations with representatives, we were finally assigned a senior case manager who promised a refund of $691.16. This included:A 30% refund for the impacted nights (as covered by the AirCover policy)A full refund for our final night (which we did not spend at the property)$246.22 to help cover the cost of a hotel for the last nightHowever, the next day the case manager reversed his decision, saying he could now only offer a partial refund totaling $234.08, plus 20% of our hotel cost. The reason provided was that the refund had not been processed by the end of his shift. I was told by another representative that the original refund would still be honored and that someone would follow up by end of day — but no one reached out until the following afternoon, and the refund offer had been reduced.This sudden change, lack of communication, and failure to follow through not only disrupted our trip but seriously undermined my trust in Airbnb’s customer support and its AirCover guarantee.

317,Worst Booking APP EVER,"Worst booking app EVER! One and done for me.Booked a stay during my daughter’s delivery date. Place not as expected, not a single family home as advertised (a duplex), homeless park nearby, lizards in home, door wouldn’t lock, tv not accessible in living room, no tvs in bedrooms, laundry supposedly in closet but wasn’t and was out in bedroom and super loud, dishwasher didn’t work, doors wouldn’t lock when exiting home, couch was so uncomfortable, rugs were dingy and dirty and felt gross to walk on, and the list goes on- all of which I just let go during the stay because what can you do… But THEN, to top it all off, I received a bill for a pet fee a week and a half later, which I paid BTW, when the listing clearly stated pets welcome and did not indicate a fee or note any specifics about payment for pets. Host even said how clean the home was upon exit but later sent pics to Air BNB, which indicated that she had gone through our trash bags to find kitty litter- which we weren’t trying to hid because we thought pets were welcome, so brought our 8 week kitten… but seriously, how weird is that to dig through someone’s trash, and then, to say home is clean but dig through the curbside trash bins to rip open bags- odd, and def not something I’d be willing to do… just eeewwww! She could’ve emailed me asking, and I would have gladly responded yes because again “pets are welcome.” I’m truly fine with a pet fee for my kitten; we pay to board most of the time anyhow, but since my daughter went into labor early that morning, we didn’t have time to board. Anyhow, all this just seems like an after the fact money grab to me when sent a week and an half after the stay ended and after reviewing saying “home left clean.” Home was in Columbia, SC under Ursula, apparently she has 8 listings in the area. So BEWARE!Also, dealing with ABNB support afterward was a nightmare. Let me be clear, once they let me know there was a request for funds I gladly said I’d pay it, just wanted info and details on what account would be charged. Support worker stopped messaging just mid convo when I questioned this, and later emailed me apologizing for his/her unprofessionalism. I’ve booked with Expedia for 20+ years and have had minor hiccups here or there but nothing that even made me angry, much less ever promoted me to sit down and write a review. But this experience was so crazy, I felt I needed to let others know. Maybe I’m in the wrong and blowing this out of proportion, but I’ve never been sent after the fact requests from Expedia or Priceline because pricing is clear and upfront, so this just all seemed so ridiculous to me.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Airbnb offered only £90 compensation, but comparable places were over £500 more.

Despite using it normally, the bed collapsed during our stay  clearly due to poor maintenance and pre-existing structural issues. Instead of acknowledging this, the host filed a damage claim for over £400, which is absolutely unreasonable for such a cheap and old bed.I explained the situation to Airbnb, including that the damage was not caused by misuse and that the item was already unsafe.

I wasn’t even aware I had to photograph furniture defects on arrival to protect myself which is an unreasonable expectation.This whole process has been stressful, unfair, and has made me lose trust in Airbnb’s support system.

Conveniently alternatives have gone up but over £1000, from which they will pocket £200 a pop. Spent the whole day back and forth with customer support who acted as if they would help, asking to choose an alternative and provide links etc, only to finally be told they can give max £95.

We stayed in an apartment in Albufeira hosted by Joaquim (stay away) and were accused by this host of losing a set of keys which was not the case as we left both sets in the apartment. I didn't think to take a picture as evidence of this as it's not a normal thing to do and we trusted our hosts throughout the most part of our stay. The host requested through airbnb for me to pay £130 to replace the missing key. I appealed this but to no avail. The Airbnb support team did not help me in any way and were quick to side with the host. I repeatedly explained to them we had done nothing wrong and how the hosts representative who came to see us out of the apartment was intimidating towards us and seemed to have a lot of keys in his hands and pockets. Their reason for supporting the hosts claim was that he reported the issue timely which had nothing to do with the situation and their messages and emails were very contradicting saying we had to pay for the ""damage we made to the property"". We made no damage whatsoever to the hosts property. it felt like the airbnb support team just weren't listening to my side of the situation or even trying to understand the situation.

One listing appeared relevant, but only after booking did I realize it was located almost two hours away. The app didn’t clearly label it as being in a different town—it just said “Villa in [Name X],” which I assumed was a creative name chosen by the host for their rental, not the name of an entirely different location.For users unfamiliar with the area, this is incredibly misleading. Airbnb shouldn’t mix listings from distant cities into a search without explicit labels and distance indicators. It’s unreasonable to expect users to research every name shown to check if it’s in the actual city they searched for and more when every other listing is in the searched area.When I raised this issue, customer support responded with scripted messages about how much they value customers—but offered no real help. No cancellation option, no credit, no solution.

Apparently there are only a couple reasons to remove reviews, and saying false or misleading information is not one of them. I've already been feeling wary of booking Airbnbs with the hassle compared to hotels, and this has sealed that for me. In addition to them not removing the review, it has been very hard to talk to anyone who knows what's going on.

Their logic? That ""not paying the second half"" counts as a refund. This was never communicated during booking, and the cancellation policy never said refunds were conditional on full prepayment.I paid based on what I was shown and what was confirmed to me by their website. Now they're refusing to refund anything and have closed the case, every time I ask for further support, they refuse it.This is unfair, misleading, and unethical.

355,As a long-standing Airbnb host who…,"As a long-standing Airbnb host who takes pride in maintaining a safe, respectful, and rule-abiding environment for guests, I’m extremely disappointed by Airbnb’s recent handling of a clear case of review abuse and policy violation.A guest stayed at my property in early July and violated several house rules, including bringing an unregistered overnight guest, misusing restricted areas, and providing false information when asked. I enforced the rules professionally and requested the additional guest fee, as Airbnb allows. Only after that did the guest leave a negative review, claiming an alleged noise disturbance (which was never raised during the stay) and falsely stating they had “no access” to the kitchen — despite having been reminded of house rules after misuse.This is a textbook example of a retaliatory and misleading review, which Airbnb’s own Review Policy clearly prohibits. I submitted a thorough appeal outlining the timeline, referencing another guest’s 5-star review from the same dates, and offered to submit CCTV and message logs. Despite this, Airbnb refused to remove the review.To make matters worse, Airbnb has refused to explain why the review was allowed to stay. No specific reason was given, and no reference to their policy was cited — only a generic rejection message claiming the issue had already been reviewed. The support process was opaque and dismissive, with agents increasingly refusing to give names, likely to avoid accountability.The last named case manager I spoke with, Giuseppe, openly admitted he didn’t know the review policy and had to place me on hold to look it up — only to then read it back to me verbatim. I have full documentation of these conversations, which clearly show a lack of knowledge, consistency, and fairness.In summary:•	Airbnb does not enforce its own review policy•	Hosts are punished for enforcing Airbnb’s guest rules•	Support is unhelpful, unaccountable, and evasive•	Case closures happen without proper review or explanationThis experience has seriously damaged my trust in Airbnb’s ability to protect its hosts.

Later they eventually issued a refund the next morning. But they clearly don’t care about the safety of their customers, especially as we were two young women. Very horrible experience wouldn’t recommend if travelling as a group of females or young children, especially not at night.When the host arrived later, he was racist and threatened to evict us at night.

360,I Was Failed by Airbnb—Safety Ignored and False Claims Upheld,"I’ve been an Airbnb host for years, welcoming guests from around the world and consistently earning only 5-star reviews. That changed during a recent, deeply distressing incident, where I was forced to ask Airbnb to remove a guest from my home due to inappropriate and intrusive behaviour that made those in the household genuinely fear for their safety.Airbnb’s own Safety Team intervened and had the guest leave early. Yet, despite clear evidence and Airbnb’s involvement, the guest was allowed to leave a blatantly retaliatory 1-star review. After weeks of appeals, Airbnb repeatedly denied my requests for removal—citing general “policy.” Now, only after I exhausted every avenue, Airbnb shifted position and introduced new allegations of “privacy violations” and “inaccuracies in the listing,” claims that were never mentioned at any earlier stage, and which are simply false.Allowing a removed guest to publish a misleading review—then retroactively justifying it with unsubstantiated counterclaims—feels like a deliberate attempt to silence legitimate concerns and protect the platform, not the host. This process has been demoralising and deeply unfair.I urge Airbnb to take host safety seriously, follow their own policies, and provide real protections for those who uphold high standards. Until then, hosts and guests should know: acting in good faith and prioritising safety does not guarantee Airbnb’s support—or even protection from reputational harm.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

The place was also filthy, but that was of less importance than the dangerous position. I did not even stay the night; the parking space for this pit was around the back of the building and (again according to the website crimerate.co.uk) was the site of several B&E offences as well as criminal damage in the last 12 months.Despite the genuinely very dangerous position of this Airbnb, the disgusting conditions it was in, and the missing amenities necessary for an Airbnb (there was no oven glove! An oven but no glove! Are you kidding?), Airbnb has given me no support in receiving even a slight refund from the host. They do not think the dozen or so sexual misdemeanours which took place directly behind the building constitute unsafe conditions, nor do they think a freezer drawer being *brown* with filth is unhygienic.I had previously had two positive stays in Airbnbs, but it seems I got lucky with them.

The apartment did not meet expectations in any way – neither in standard nor in relation to the high price.Here are some of the most serious issues:🧼 Cleanliness and hygiene:– Blood stains on the bed linen– Dirty and partly torn bath towels (and no clean ones provided)– No hand towels or kitchen towels available– Urine splashes on the bathroom floor– Wet, used cleaning cloths stuffed into a cabinet– Old food left in the fridge and dirty dishes in the kitchen– Greasy surfaces, sticky cupboards, and dusty furniture– Coffee grounds still in the coffee machine upon arrival🌡️ Indoor climate and comfort:– No air conditioning and no fan available – the apartment became unbearably hot at night– No curtains in the living room to block sunlight– The stovetop was locked with no instructions, making it impossible to cook (despite us clearly stating that we were traveling with kids and needed to prepare meals)🚗 Parking confusion and financial loss:Before our arrival, we explicitly asked where to park. The listing said street parking was available, but everything was marked “Private Parking” with no clear guidance.We received no reply, and unfortunately ended up with a parking ticket costing around 1,000 DKK. The host completely ignored this issue and never acknowledged it – let alone offered to help or reimburse us.The host's response only made things worse:We reached out to the host right away with a detailed list of the issues, requesting urgent cleaning and reasonable compensation. The reply we received was a few short, dismissive lines – no apology, no solution. Cleaning was promised, but several hours later we were informed there was only one key – and we had it with us. When we explained that we had gone out for the day with the children and had clearly stated a time window for access, the host responded by claiming that we were being uncooperative and that help was therefore withdrawn. This was an extremely manipulative and passive-aggressive use of power dynamics.To top it off, before departure we received a message from the host stressing the importance of us leaving the apartment “in the same fine condition as we found it(!)”The whole situation felt calculated and insincere.🌟 The only positive part of our experience was Airbnb’s customer service. We received prompt, professional, and trustworthy help – special thanks to Mike and the team.We have documented everything with around 20 photos and saved all communication with the host.

Until recently, I had no major issues. But what happened in Encarnación, Paraguay was so poorly handled that I can no longer trust the platform.I booked an apartment with a host named José, who never contacted me directly. All communication was outsourced to a building manager who gave confusing check-in instructions — we got lost. I requested two sets of keys for myself and my girlfriend but was told there was only one and it couldn’t be duplicated.The building was far from the city center. After a disagreement, my partner left with the only key. The manager refused to help, and I had to ask neighbors to get back in. Three days later, Airbnb suddenly canceled my reservation and removed me from the listing without any warning, explanation, or opportunity to respond.When I contacted the manager, she vaguely mentioned “complaints” — likely about noise — but I was never warned, never approached, and never allowed to explain myself. I was told at 2:00 PM that I had to leave by 6:00 PM. With no transportation and little time, I had to move in a rush. At 6:30 PM, the building manager called the police to force me out. I lost valuable belongings, including a wallet with ID and cards and a charger.Airbnb has refused to say what was reported. And now I’ve been banned entirely from the platform. After seven years and a near-perfect rating, I was cut off without due process or recourse.I’ve filed a complaint with SEDECO (consumer protection in Paraguay) and am exploring legal action.

384,Covering up hosts committing fraud,"Supporting and covering up hosts committing fraud.Upon arrival at the property the host told me that €300 deposit needed to be taken to make sure the property was returned clean, tidy and with no damage.No mention of this in the listing when I raised this issue the host denied it. Despite there being a notice on the wall of the property, stating the €300 deposit would not be returned if we don’t do a face-to-face check out handover the keys.Airbnb were scared of losing the host so they sided with him on this issue.Secondly, we were charged €30 for using the second bed in a two bed property which we confirmed two people would be staying in.Airbnb sided with us on this case, however didn’t take the €30 off of the host, instead paid it themselves not to upset them.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
385,Airbnb Failed Me Completely – Dangerous and Dishonest Host Protected,"I’ve been using Airbnb for years, but after my last experience in Vitré, France, I’ve completely lost trust in the platform.The apartment I stayed in was in appalling condition. There was a persistent, sickening mold smell throughout the house. The air conditioning unit didn’t work properly because the filter was completely clogged with dust I had to clean it myself just to get it running. The towels provided were filthy and stained. I had to pay out of pocket to wash them. Despite the listing clearly stating Wi-Fi was available, there was no connection and since I was working remotely, I had to pay to work from another location.Worst of all, we heard rats crawling in the walls at night. It was impossible to sleep. The house was not just dirty it was a sanitary hazard. The garden was overgrown and filled with weeds, the trash bins were full when we arrived, and there were cobwebs and dust in every corner. The kitchen sponge was moldy and unusable. The smell inside the house was so bad that it made it hard to breathe.Despite all of this, I decided to leave a polite and moderate review, because I didn’t want to deal with drama or potential retaliation while I was still staying there. That was a mistake. The host retaliated by leaving a false and offensive review accusing me of being unclean a complete reversal of reality.I contacted Airbnb immediately, expecting support. Instead, they told me that because I didn’t file a complaint within 72 hours of check-in, there was nothing they could do. This policy is absolutely outrageous. It ignores the real risks of being stuck in a property where you fear confrontation or retaliation. It assumes that all problems can and should be reported immediately even when you’re still locked into a stay and vulnerable.Airbnb’s refusal to remove the false review, or take any action against the host, shows how broken their system is. They claim to value guest safety, but in reality, they protect hosts even dishonest and negligent ones over paying guests who are just trying to have a decent experience.This was not just an inconvenience. It was a fraudulent listing, a toxic environment, and a failure of Airbnb’s duty of care. I no longer feel safe using this platform, and I will not be booking through Airbnb again. If you care about your health, safety, and dignity as a traveler, I suggest you think twice.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

387,I don’t usually leave negative reviews,"I don’t usually leave negative reviews, but my experience with Airbnb deserves to be shared. From start to finish, this was one of the most frustrating customer service experiences I’ve had with any company.My frustration started when I tried to book the first property, the listing had a price for the dates I booked however in the process I was asked what the reason was for my stay? Now I figured this question was simply to block people from having parties and what not so I responded we were visting elderly family in the area and since it would be football season might attend a game, if the local team had a home game that weekend and it would be easier to get them to the game from there. The property already had a price listed but was then told if I made the reservation and it was announced their was a home game I would be required to pay them more money or have my rservation canceled. I decided to look elsewhere as to me this is simply price gouging and taken advantage of people. I then completed a booking at another location that asked no questions and had a confirmed booking. Two weeks later NFL schedule was announced and sure enough there would be a game that weekend. Well fast forward another month and I get an alert that my Airbnb was cancelled. I reached out to the host hoping it was a mistake and was told there was an error on Airbnb's side and I could go ahead and  rebook, well when I did the same host raised the booking almost $750, I messaged them again and was told along the lines of oh well thats the price now, book it or don't. I contacted Airbnb support immediately expecting help, but what I got instead was a series of copy-and-paste responses, endless back-and-forth emails, and a complete lack of accountability. It felt like no one actually read my messages or took my concerns seriously.I was bounced between multiple agents who all asked me to “be patient” while doing absolutely nothing. When I finally received a response, they sided with the host, and said their host can cancel at anytime up to check in for any reason as it is their property. Again understandable in some circumstances but since the listing was misrepresented and the host only cancelled to jack up the price seemed to be unfair and very unsettling.I expected Airbnb to protect its guests, but instead, I was left to deal with a bad situation on my own. Their “support” system is disorganized, slow, and ultimately useless.This experience has completely ruined my trust in Airbnb. I’ll be looking elsewhere for travel accommodations in the future, never again using this site — and I suggest others do the same.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

394,Airbnb failures,"Airbnb must take responsibility for its guests. Hosts are allowed to post misleading or heavily photoshopped pictures and vague descriptions of their properties. When guests arrive and find the property doesn’t match their expectations, they risk losing money if they cancel. This practice is illegal under UK trading standards laws.Additionally, Airbnb needs to change its policy regarding payment collection. Guests should not be charged before the host confirms the booking. If the property is unavailable after booking, guests may wait up to 15 working days for a refund, which unfairly disadvantages them.Moreover, Airbnb must enforce stricter requirements for hosts to accurately list the location of their properties, including whether they are situated on a council estate. Hosts should also be mandated to provide photos of the property's exterior and details regarding accessibility. These changes are essential to protect guests and ensure transparency within the platform.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

We travel alot all over the USA and the globe, and have never had anyone have any issues with this. Thank goodness we were only charged $105.40, but we felt the fault lay in improper cleaning, probably with hot water.

To my surprise, Airbnb refused to issue a refund, citing the host’s cancellation policy.I understand policies exist, but this was clearly an honest mistake, corrected within minutes. What’s more disappointing is the lack of flexibility and empathy from Airbnb’s customer support. I reached out hoping for a reasonable resolution, but was met with a rigid response and no real effort to help.As a long-time user of Airbnb, this experience has left me questioning the platform’s commitment to fairness and customer care.

397,Charged nearly $200 for Damage We Did Not Do,"We have booked many stays through Air B and B. Our last one was our last one we will ever use. That is when we realized there is no one to go to when problems arise from an abusive and lying host. A host can literally make up a bucket of lies and also post a very damaging and false review of a guest (which one did of us) and nothing is done. We were billed 2 weeks after our stay $179 for things we did not break and items not even in the house! Here is the list of lies we were billed for: $50 extra cleaning (I spent over an hour cleaning the place. We slept in only 1 room out of 3. Cleaned bathroom thoroughly. Wiped down living room, dining area, and kitchen. Put towels in tub (used dog towels from closet as the host left us no towels). We rented that place because the host listed it as within walking distance to a major event in Kansas City. The walk was a 2-mile walk across four lanes of a busy highway, returning at night in an unsafe area. It was rather terrifying for us. My husband made it across the traffic but I nearly fell in front of a truck and returned to my side of the busy 4-lane highway. A homeless man came up to me and stood telling me to just go out into the traffic. It took me about 5 minutes to be able to get across the highway. This ruined our night since we knew we had to repeat that walk to get back to the house. You had to cross a huge empty parking lot, cross the full one as well, enter a graffiti tunnel with a blind curve, go up 2 flights of old concrete stairs, cross a walking bridge, all this while it was 95 degrees. Two people followed us down the dark sidewalk and no sidewalk in one place by a deserted house. Next we were billed $80 for breaking a 40-year-old dishwasher that had an old knob. We never used the thing. There was no dish soap in the house and no dishwasher soap. No dish cloths either. Next we were billed $40 for broken and dirty dishes. She put a photo of some ceramic dish that we never even saw in the house. She put a photo of some pan that needed to be washed. The Air B and B help was no help. I did 2 appeals and they sided with the host. We realized a host could put anything and bill a guest. We looked up reviews and this very thing was prevalent. Some guests were charged hundreds and even $1000 for things they did not break. One person was charged for new floor in the house. Another was charged for a new shower. A relative of ours was charged $1000 for damage but thankfully their credit card reversed charges. The house we were in smelled like a kennel. The host had throws on the couch which was urine soaked from dogs. Lastly, there was a party in the basement until I complained at 2:00 a.m. The host was one of the people in the basement making the noise. She wrote a negative review of us telling an absolute lie -that we had told her up front - let us stay free or we will write a bad review. How can they allow such lies to remain. I contested the review but Air B and B said it will remain, and it did -the only negative review of us in all these year. The other many reviews on us state the same thing: Nice couple. Very sweet. Left our place very clean. Left our place spotless. That is because we are nice and we do clean the places better than when we arrived since we used to be a host. Will never book through Air B and B again. You cannot delete your own account. You have to request that they delete it. Ours is still up. We will have to contact our credit card company to tell them we do not agree to any more charges. There is no oversight.  We once stayed and cut short a week stay at a place that made you put used toilet paper in a bucket. Another place had no bathroom although it said it did. There was a toilet and no sink in the bedroom. Another was in a horrible neighborhood in a big city and it had an old camper right outside on blocks with people staying in it. There was a chop shop of sorts up against the little house we stayed in. Saws and drills went all night long in it. Another place in Colorado had a honey pot and no bathroom. My husband was not happy about that one.  There was no bed either, just a pull-out couch. We pulled the thin mattress off onto the floor. Still could not sleep on it. Was a remote place in the mountains, so stuck for the night. But my main complaint is the risk of being billed for things you did not do and lies being allowed to stick about you. I have been fighting this for 5 weeks now. I give up! Never will I ever use Air B and B again. And we loved them for so long.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

The guest had just pulled up to the house, and before he even gout out of his vehicle, a neighbor apparently pulled along side of the guest and warned him not to park where he was.  I later learned that that the guest and neighbor nearly got into a physical altercation.Well, after the altercation, the guest reached out to me through the Airbnb Messenger indicating he had an issue with a neighbor and decided to leave.  Before I reached out to the guest I reached out to neighbors to find out what happened and I this is when I learned that the guest apparently has anger issues.  I reached out to the guest to discuss the matter and after talking, he indicated he would pay for the 1 night; however, wanted a refund for the remaining days.  When I explained that his altercation has nothing to do with me and I could not refund him, he proved his anger issues and hung up and then reached out to Airbnb where he lied not only to them, but through his review and stated my STR appeared to be abandoned and rundown.

412,Airbnb Dispute: Forced Payment and Lack of Support,"We rented an apartment through Airbnb for our Rome vacation from June 23rd to 29th and were unfortunately scammed. The property is listed as ""Laura's house in Alborone"", and the host is Alessandro Pala. I later discovered that the previous guest, who rented the apartment a week before us, was also forced to pay for a curtain and a chair that they allegedly didn't damage. Regrettably, I only saw this review after we had returned home.The host applied the same tactic to us. There were eight of us in the house. Even though we didn't use the bathroom on the day he specified and we checked everything when we left, he claimed that water overflowed from the bathroom, damaging the floor below. He then illegally entered the apartment without our permission while we were out, supposedly to perform repairs, and demanded compensation. We only learned about this incident upon returning to the apartment. When I took photos of the bathrooms that same day, there was still dust visible on the door frames and the floor. It was clear that if the house had been flooded and cleaned as he claimed, all the dust would have been gone.When we told him we absolutely would not pay for something we didn't do and asked him to send us a video of the incident, he didn't respond to us for a week. He only filed a compensation claim after we returned to our home country. The pictures he uploaded only show the toilet and the floor, where very little water is visible. There are no pictures or videos of the overall bathroom area where our personal belongings were; I uploaded those myself. He only uploaded a video of the downstairs area, which he claimed had a water leak. Since very little water flows in the bathroom, there's no way it would overflow even if left running.Furthermore, he charged the previous guest for a chair and a curtain, and then he demanded the same amount from us, claiming we damaged a curtain and a chair. When we arrived, one of the chairs was already broken, but we didn't pay attention to it as it wasn't needed. However, we should have been more careful with such a malicious person. We are individuals in certain positions, yet we were forced to pay money in this way. I'm writing this in such detail so that others do not have to experience the same thing. It seems we need to act like an expert, performing a full property inspection and recording it, taking detailed videos for each day to avoid being victims like us. Despite sending a video of the apartment to Airbnb upon leaving, showing no problems with the curtains, we were still forced to pay compensation for them.He demanded approximately 1300 Euros from us for this. My trust in Airbnb is completely gone. The host will simply upload a general photo, claim he illegally entered the property to make repairs, and then take this money from us. He has a key to the apartment; he could easily wet a small area, take pictures with two people, and demand the same thing again.Despite my repeated objections, my requests for images and evidence from Airbnb and the host to prove the incident occurred during my stay, and even my demand to see the pictures uploaded by the host with their creation dates, my appeal was rejected without any consideration. As a result, I was forced to pay approximately 900 euro. More than the money itself, I am furious about being compelled to pay for something I did not do. If I had actually caused the alleged damage and been asked for even more money, I wouldn't be nearly as angry.Since Airbnb doesn't have an office in Turkey, I cannot take them to the Consumer Court. This was my first experience with Airbnb, based on positive reviews, and I've now realized that Airbnb enables people to be scammed out of their money and completely on the side of the homeowners. It's absolutely crucial to choose more professional and impartial applications and platforms.I waited for your dispute to be fully resolved on Airbnb before writing a review about the property but when I realized they weren't going to resolve it, I tried to write a review on what they said was the last day for comments. However, they then told me my review period had expired, and my review was not published.

Most recently, a guest left a false and extremely serious accusation claiming we had hidden cameras — a criminal allegation with zero evidence. Airbnb refused to remove the review, even though it violates multiple parts of their own Review Policy.No investigation. No follow-up. No accountability.This isn’t an isolated incident. Over the past year, we’ve had dozens of situations where Airbnb sided with guests — even when they were clearly violating rules, lying, or damaging property. We’ve lost thousands of dollars in damages, refunds, and lost bookings, and Airbnb support has been nonexistent every single time.Airbnb likes to promote “community,” but the truth is: hosts are disposable. We take all the risk, and when something goes wrong, Airbnb turns its back.We are now moving our listings off the platform and warning other hosts: if you care about your business, your reputation, and your safety — don’t rely on Airbnb.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
414,Can you trust Airbnb in their hosts?,I booked an apartment in Paris around March for an July 8th. Stay for 10 days. 3 weeks before I was supposed to go to Paris they sent me a cancellation notice. Even though I had paid. At the last minute. I was having to find another apartment with limited choices in the apartment I found is a dump and cost me more money. Airbnb needs to compensate us and find the host when they do that. I've used Airbnb for many years and I'm not going to use them anymore as their hosts decide to cancel at the last minute which is totally unacceptable and they have no compensation rules for the person that's booked the apartment and gets screwed out of it.

She was completely immobile and in a wheelchair. Airbnb failed us.Of the 3 showers advertised, only 1 worked. The master only misted. The guest faucet never worked. The dishwasher tipped over—it wasn’t bolted. The sink didn’t drain. The laundry door was broken for 12 days, and our daughter has sound sensitivity.The pool was unusable—dirty daily, bees, filter failure. Our son couldn’t use it, despite it being his only outlet. The garage was listed both as included and not—but it was essential for wheelchair access.We were in constant contact with the host. We only contacted Airbnb 10 days in. They offered a $2,000 refund—then revoked it. Final decision blamed a guest count mistake (we told the host 4 people were staying).This was not a vacation—it was about helping our daughter heal. And Airbnb refused to take accountability.-Amazingly since posting complaint on Better Business Bureau, review on Trusted advisor.com and here, and also an email to the Airbnb executive team, Airbnb reached out and finally honored their $1500 original refund offer, and also added a $200 coupon on future trips (upon which we actually have one coming that had already been booked before this Poway, CA trip) on top of the $340 already refunded by host (total $2040 on a trip of $7500+, roughly 27% discount total).

Do not stay here! So much better places available, with much more value for money and not a host that is after your money afterwards.When we arrived, the space smelled musty. There was construction going on in the apartment downstairs, which caused constant noise disturbance. The fridge made loud noises throughout the night, and everything felt sticky and unclean. Should we have reported this? At hindsight, yes. But we travelled the world from the Netherlands and we did not want this stay to ruin our holiday to the beautiful Hawaï island. Well this stay was ruined by the host, seaside properties and Airbnb afterwards.After our stay, we received a message by the host claiming we had left a stain on a wooden nightstand—and were charged ~600 USD for it.! Honestly we never even noticed it. We might have made a stain or not (there were many already). Certainly it was not damaged, broken or something that could not be fixed. Maybe it was done by cleaners/others before or after. this is something that could be fixed and not something you have to pay 600 for because you need to buy new ones. These hosts, along with Airbnb, seem to be motivated solely by making money afterwards. What a rip-off.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Despite this, she was allowed to leave two dishonest and damaging reviews.Under Airbnb’s own review policy, I’m entitled to submit two removal requests per review — yet support repeatedly shut me down after my first request, wrongly stating the case was reviewed “twice” when I had only submitted one request per review for two different bookings.Worse still:•	I was called at 2:09 AM by Airbnb support, which is completely inappropriate.•	My support thread was closed prematurely, and I was met with copy-paste responses instead of real answers.•	I’ve asked multiple times how to properly submit my second removal request, and no one will help.As a Superhost, I expected to be treated with respect — especially after raising genuine safety concerns.

I should have documented everything and cancelled my trip, but I didn’t know any better. I stayed and cleaned it up.I left an honest review of my opinion and experiences. The host, Joanna G., is a malicious, unprofessional bully with serious anger issues. She was upset that I didn’t rate her five stars, so she sent a snarky, sarcastic message to my inbox and left an incredibly rude response to my review, saying that I was lying and acting strange, and that I wasn’t welcome back.I decided to request a partial refund because her antagonistic behavior was the nail in the coffin. I was courteous and respectful, and I provided photos. Joanna threw an absolute temper tantrum. She denied my request, said I was lying, and called me a scammer. She told me to “stay somewhere I could afford” next time; she really thinks her moldy shack is the Taj Mahal!She threatened me and tried to intimidate me by saying that “I should be very careful” because “she’s the wrong person to mess with.” She even sent me a screenshot of my full name and address! She was basically threatening to dox me unless I dropped the issue.Of course, she blocked me before I could respond because she’s a coward and a control-freak who needs to have the last word. I called the police to report Joanna’s threats, and she’s now falsely accusing me of telephonic harassment. (I don’t even have her number, we communicated through the app)!Airbnb won’t refund me the amount I asked for because “it’s up to the host and she denied.” They refunded me a measly $200 when I spent about $830+ They’re acting so unhelpful and indifferent about this when I spent all day talking to support, feeling scared for my safety, and physically shaking because I was so upset.

431,Airbnb Customer Service From Hell,"This rating serves as a formal complaint and request for corrective action regarding Airbnb’s mishandling of our review submission process, as discussed with multiple representatives, including Jenesis, a senior supervisor.As I have clearly explained, my concern lies in Airbnb’s failure to allow the submission of a valid second review following incorrect information provided by Airbnb staff. Specifically, during a call placed several days ago, an Airbnb representative explicitly stated that no review had been submitted from our account. Based on this information—which I now understand to have been inaccurate—I immediately informed my husband, who submitted a new review in good faith, believing the original had not been recorded.It is highly disturbing that Airbnb representatives now claim this sequence of events is irrelevant. The facts are fully supported by Airbnb’s internal call logs and timestamped review records. The assertion that my account is inaccurate is not only factually incorrect but, as conveyed by Jenesis, is unprofessionally dismissive and borders on defamatory. His refusal to acknowledge this as a technical issue or to engage with the facts objectively is unacceptable and appears to reflect a lack of due process and good faith.As a long-standing and paying Airbnb Superhost, I am entitled to accurate information, transparency, and equitable treatment. The failure to recognize an error that originated with Airbnb, which subsequently resulted in our inability to provide meaningful and timely feedback, is both negligent and harmful. The implication that my input is now invalid due to internal errors—errors I was assured did not exist—raises serious concerns about procedural fairness and potential liability on Airbnb’s part.Furthermore, I was informed by Jenesis that there exists a formal policy prohibiting Airbnb staff from disclosing the feedback evaluation process. If this is accurate, it raises grave concerns about transparency and accountability. Customers must have the right to understand how their feedback is handled—particularly when that feedback could influence significant financial outcomes for hosts.The overall handling of this situation appears, at best, negligent and, at worst, intentionally obstructive. I request an immediate and impartial investigation into this matter. I further expect a written response clarifying (1) whether the review submission timeline corroborates my account, (2) what corrective action will be taken to allow for fair review submission, and (3) what formal policy supports the denial of transparency as described by Jenesis.Please consider this notice a documented escalation. Should this matter not be addressed adequately and in a timely manner, I will be compelled to explore all available legal remedies, including but not limited to filing complaints with consumer protection agencies and pursuing recourse for damages incurred by this procedural failure.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

It was outdated, dirty, and in poor condition. The shower had visible mold, light fixtures were literally taped to the walls, and the place didn’t match the photos at all. It was also missing a washer, even though the listing claimed there was one.To make matters worse, the host failed to send us check-in information, even though we clearly communicated our arrival time. We were left waiting outside for over an hour and had to call to finally get access. Throughout the stay, the host was unresponsive and claimed to have missed our messages. The apartment was also extremely noisy due to being right next to a train line and a busy road something the listing failed to mention.I reported all of this to Airbnb, expecting a fair resolution. Despite these serious issues, they only offered a small refund. That response felt completely inadequate given the situation. It made me feel like Airbnb doesn't take guest concerns seriously or uphold the standards they claim to enforce.Airbnb needs to do much better in holding hosts accountable and supporting guests when things go wrong.

Upon entering the property shortly after, I found substantial damage: furniture broken, household items destroyed, and the unit left in a severely unclean state. The condition of the home was distressing to the point I was unable to speak for several minutes due to the shock and stress.Given that I had another guest arriving at 4:00 PM the same day, I was forced to act immediately. I hired a contractor for urgent repairs and paid for additional cleaning personnel to restore the property to a presentable and safe condition.I submitted a claim through Airbnb’s Resolution Center for $1,125, supported by legitimate invoices for repair and cleaning. Despite full documentation, the Airbnb case manager unilaterally reduced my reimbursement to $440, without providing adequate justification. In particular, my dining table, originally purchased for $1,500 including six chairs, was assessed at a mere $212.Airbnb initially assured me that damages would be covered under their Host Guarantee. However, the actual outcome reflects a serious lack of support and responsibility on their part. The process was unreasonably delayed, communication was minimal, and the final decision grossly undervalued the verified losses I incurred.This situation has caused undue stress, financial loss, and an erosion of trust in Airbnb as a platform that claims to protect its hosts. I am formally requesting a review of this case, and I am prepared to escalate the matter through consumer protection avenues if necessary.Airbnb must be held accountable for honoring the policies they advertise to hosts — anything less is misleading and unacceptable.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

If someone cancels in good faith for valid reasons, and Airbnb offers zero protection or action, then why should anyone feel safe booking through the platform?Truly disgraceful customer service.

457,Came For A Vacation.. Almost Walked Into A Nightmare,"I’ve never written a review like this, but what happened to my family and me deserves serious attention—not just as a customer complaint, but as a safety warning.We arrived late at night to our Airbnb rental after a long day of travel, exhausted and just hoping to get our kids into bed.Trusting Airbnb’s built-in navigation feature—something we assumed would be accurate and reliable—we followed the provided directions. What happened next was completely unacceptable: the navigation led us to the next door neighbors home. In the dark, with unfamiliar surroundings, and in a residential neighborhood, we unknowingly approached and tried to access a private home that was not our rental. The neighbors, THANKFULLY, opened their door and graciously told the two frazzled women and their three children in tow trying to break into their home, that the AirBnB that we were looking for was next door.I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous this situation could have become. Imagine being a homeowner and seeing strangers—my family and I—approaching your door at 10pm, shaking your door, pissed off that the door code isn't working. It’s a terrifying scenario for both parties. We were lucky. The residents were understandably alarmed but not confrontational. Had the homeowners been more frightened or defensive, or had this occurred in a place with heightened security concerns, the outcome could have been catastrophic. People have been shot in driveways for less. We reached out to the host, and he was responsive, but didn't seem to recognize the gravity of the situation.We were shaken, and deeply unsettled. This was not user error. This was a failure of Airbnb’s system—a failure with potentially grave consequences.I want to be clear: this isn’t just an inconvenience or a tech glitch. It’s a serious safety flaw. Airbnb cannot afford to have its internal navigation directing guests to the wrong addresses, especially not at night and especially not when tensions can escalate quickly in unfamiliar neighborhoods. If Airbnb is going to offer built-in navigation tools, they must be rigorously verified and guaranteed accurate. Otherwise, don’t offer them at all. Until this issue is addressed, I strongly urge future guests to double-check addresses manually using trusted map services—and I urge Airbnb to treat this as the liability risk and public safety hazard it clearly is.We came for a vacation.

Stained headboard, broken bed which a panel fell on my mums leg. We went away as a family for my brothers wedding with babies and our dog which the listing clearly stated pets were allowed (at no extra charge or authorisation needed). Air BnB have been no help as they stated we should have made air BnB aware on day one so they could move us. We could not be moved or have the time do this as mentioned we had babies and were there for my brothers wedding so we couldn’t just leave the wedding to be moved houses - it’s completely impractical. I have picture evidence of everything including WhatsApp messages proving we notified the host of all the issues immediately. The house was not maintained and was quite frankly filthy to the point we had to clean it and sleep on top of sleeping bags on the bed. I have left a bad review on the hosts which has now resulted in them leaving a bed review about us - which is laughable. The whole process is floored and we were only refunded £125 cleaning fee, out of the £1,200 we wait. It’s honestly a joke. I use Airbnb all the time and the one time we have had a problem it’s not gone against us.

I walked into the home and immediately the first thing I saw was overgrown grass up to my 6 foot tall husband’s waist into the stomach with abandoned shopping carts everywhere. They said we would have use of a patio that was a lie. The entire property wreaked like animal urine, and you could see spots on the carpet and on the couch, where there was obvious animal urine. Outside of that there was food left in the sink. There was food left in the microwave. The entire floor was gross. I believe this just touches the surface of everything that I encountered and that my children were forced to sleep in the animal Urine smell because I was told by the host to just use for breeze we didn’t get in until 11:30 PM so we had no choice but to sleep there. Another thing we were not told is you could hear every movement going through the house so nobody got any sleep. I contacted Airbnb immediately at 5 AM the next morning. I went on for days with Airbnb, trying to get a refund I was told at one point I would receive a refund I didn’t. I was told to leave the property immediately that morning, and I would get a refund which I left the property and still again no refund at the very beginning of our trip I had to come out another $700 just to find last-minute housing for me and my family finally after days of arguing with Airbnb they only refunded me half of what I paid for the week of the Airbnb, which they didn’t even want to do that. The only reason they did was because what they claimed was an employee that was not qualified to told me that I would get a refund. I went to the highest person at Airbnb.

487,One of the Worst Airbnb Experiences Ever – Safety Nightmare and Total Scam,"The property we stayed at is an absolute disgrace and a ticking time bomb of safety hazards. Most alarming was the padlock on the back deck gate, which meant there was only one exit through the front door. In an emergency like a fire, we could have been trapped and killed inside. When I raised this very real and obvious safety issue with the host, my concern was flat-out ignored. This is likely a blatant violation of the fire code and the short-term rental ordinance of Pagosa Springs.To make matters worse, there were multiple surveillance cameras installed around the property—some shockingly aimed directly into private living spaces like bedrooms and the living room. This is a massive invasion of privacy and absolutely unacceptable.One upstairs bedroom had a rough, unfinished wood floor with exposed nails—combined with the house’s “shoes off” policy, this was a recipe for injuries. One of our guests found out the hard way with cuts and splinters.The kitchen was another horror show. The “non-stick” cookware had lost all its coating, meaning anyone cooking with it was being poisoned with PFAS chemicals—known carcinogens linked to cancer. The grill was filthy and caked with grease, completely unusable and a major fire hazard. Thank goodness we checked it before trying to light it.There was also a cracked ceramic tile in the kitchen with razor-sharp edges, creating yet another spot where you had to wear shoes indoors for basic safety.The so-called “game room” was a pathetic joke—after cramming in the ping pong and shuffleboard tables, there were only inches left for a person to squeeze in, rendering these amenities completely useless.In the primary bedroom, there were no bedside lamps, forcing us to stumble around in the dark to find wall switches every night.When we arrived, the home was stifling and smelled off, with an indoor temperature of 90 degrees. It took hours to cool it down to 75, and with no cooling upstairs, those rooms were basically uninhabitable during the day and well into the night.The host, VIP Vacation Services in Pagosa Springs, was the worst part. They ignored safety concerns, insisted on communicating outside of Airbnb, and demanded additional payments outside the platform—both clear violations of Airbnb’s policies.Airbnb support has been a complete joke in trying to resolve these issues, offering no meaningful solution so far.

I was deeply concerned for my health, and my dog developed breathing problems after this stay.Support was slow, and in the end, they said a full refund was “not possible,” even though I followed all the steps required by Airbnb’s policies.

491,Stayed in what was supposed to be 5 star,"Stayed in what was supposed to be a super host 5 star accommodation described by Air B and B in Hollow cottage Doolin co Clare. The house was dirty and not near the village as described. When I went back to Air B and B looking for compensation although the people I spoke to were polite the whole system is ridiculous, I don't know how many times I had to ring and I resend the pictures. I would urge anyone to read the small print re refunds before you book with them, and really I would suggest not using them at all. Although I received a minimum refund from the host it did not reflect the awful stay we had. I was told I should have left the place and try and find new accommodation when I was in Doolin to attend my nieces wedding and there was no other accommodation available. Clearly as a business they don't really care about peoples reviews and experiences. I do feel sorry for the genuine super hosts that put so much effort into making their accommodation good when there are other like we had that Air B and B claim is 5 star when I wouldn't rate is as even one star. I would love to be able to show the pictures I took so everyone could see what I mean but they don't even give you that chance.

492,Falsely Accused by Airbnb Host – 3 Years Without Justice or Support,"I’m writing this after nearly three years of trying to resolve a completely false and damaging accusation made by an Airbnb host, and once again, Airbnb’s customer support has shut down the conversation without providing any real help.During a group trip, the host accused me and my guests of watching adult content on their television — a completely false and unfounded claim. Even more disturbing is how the host manipulated the platform by writing “P orn” (with a space) in the review to bypass Airbnb’s moderation system. Despite this clear manipulation and the fact that the accusation is baseless, the review remains on the platform.To make matters worse, I was removed from the trip after the stay, which prevented me from leaving my own review or responding publicly to defend myself. I lost my right to reply, while the host was allowed to publicly attack my character.I contacted Airbnb support multiple times over the past three years. Each time, I carefully explained the situation and submitted evidence. The response has always been the same: “We consider the case closed.” No real review, no fair process, no support for the guest — just a dead-end.The host’s accusation is not just petty — it is harmful, embarrassing, and untrue. It has affected my reputation on the platform and caused me enormous frustration. It’s shocking that Airbnb allows hosts to make defamatory claims without proof, and then silences the guest who is trying to respond.I’ve always used Airbnb with respect and followed the rules. I never expected to be treated this way — not just by a dishonest host, but by a platform that claims to “build trust” and “support the community.”After years of being ignored, I’m sharing my story here in hopes that someone will listen. Airbnb must be held accountable when it fails to protect its users from false accusations and one-sided reviews.

494,"Betsy the retro caravan in Dundee, bad hosts on airbnb","Booked ""Betsy the retro caravan in the woods"" in Angus, Scotland with the host Sally Marie in March this year for the 5th of July. The host knew it was for 2 festival goers and that the festival closes at 11pm. They asked tonight, the day before the booking what time we'd arrive only to state they didn't want my custom as there would be 2 cars as one guest is from Aberdeen and she was going to meet us there & I am from Glasgow. They stated they didn't want us coming back in the early hours as we'd ""rouse"" the guard dogs and other guests. There was only 2 people staying there as per the rules which wouldn't have been broken by us. They knew we'd be getting back late anyway as we are attending a festival. I've had to cancel the booking the night before we were due to stay because this host didn't state there was a curfew.No where on their listing do they state the type of guests they wanted nor did they say parking was limited.Is discrimination over the type of guests we are and their hosts communication is terrible. I did try and speak with them in march only to be told speak nearer the time.So now I'm left with one day to find alternative accommodation for 2 people.They have stated we are not the sort of guests they want as we'd annoy other guests and the animals because we'd be getting back in the early morning, probably around 6am due to attending an club night then visiting a friend, it's discrimination not wanting two 40 year old women because we will attend a festival then a night club.If they wanted tea drinking oaps and the sort of customers that prefer watching antiques roadshow over visiting clubs they should state it on their listing.Not happy with Airbnb and this useless host at all",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Got a room reserved for 2 nights (May 13-15, 2025) and when I walked in, I immediately left and asked for a refund. Felt extremely unsafe, wasnt cleaned in what looked like a year, and the host was rude and unprofessional telling me to clean the room and bathroom myself if I want to check in at 5pm (the regular check in time). Host fined me $800 USD for damages (I didnt do) and left an extremely negative and completely false review. After speaking with 6 people because Airbnb made this a 2 month thing.....they still didn't do anything. Because of my truthful review, the host fined a report of discrimination, THIS IS A JOKE!!!! Its insane because there was none and i was polite the entire time to her. When I reached out to Airbnb to see the status of this on July 2, yes no help since May 13......instead of approving my request of deleting the hosts false review of me, Airbnb deleted MY TRUTHFUL review. And when checking on the hosts account, the other negative review that was there (similar to mine) was ALSO DELETED so this host now has 5 stars because out honest reviews were taken off......Airbnb is NOT on your team. This is a very short review because the full story is VERY lengthy. The fact that the worst experience & host on Airbnb HIDES honest reviews, this doesn't make me safe trusting other hosts because it could be the same situation as this one. Airbnb and this host has emotionally distressed me and at this point, with their ""resolution"" have lost me as a client forever and have gained a free bad review anytime I can share the cult Airbnb is. I want to leave a review about Airbnb on Airbnb but it doesn't seem to be an option. At this point I will use other apps or just get the damn hotel. Protect yourselves.EDIT: they said they will not remove the host's false, defamatory and triggering (because of the hosts abuse to me) review.

Finally I called.At this point I had put in my license photos, confirmed my name, put in the last four of my social, and confirmed my mailing address.

She said mmmhmm to which I asked please for a yes or no - got an mmhmm again so I asked two more times and finally she said “for full transparency no they may take 24 hours.”I asked to be handed to a supervisor and when I finally got one they gaslit me, told me I hadn’t verified even as I told them they could reference the recording from the previous rep and that I could email them screenshots. They wasted my time for another hour before figuring out I WAS verified and it was their fault - during which time I lost the reservation and it was booked when I reached out to try to reserve again once they cleared the issue.I will not go back and would rather pay more for a hotel or try VRBO then ever interact with them again.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

The booking was part confirmed, and I'd made an initial deposit payment when i was told I had to have my identity verified.For some reason, AirBNB's system could not do this simply by matching my debit card details with my address (despite me living at the same address for over ten years). Instead they wanted a form of photo ID. They specified either a driving licence; passport or national identity card.Well, I still have the old fashioned paper driving licence and the UK does not have a national identity card. My passport has my photo on it but is expired. however, I proceeded to submitted it anyway, confident that would be acceptable. After all:a) it was acceptable to the Electoral Commission (allowing me to vote UK elections); andb) it was acceptable to my last employer (when they offered me s job).No, it was rejected by AirBNB due tit o being expired.When I rang up to query what alternative there were, i was told, there wasn't any. I pointed out, both on the phone and in an email to customer services, that:a) it is not compulsory to learn to drive;b) it is not compulsory to travel abroad; andc) the UK doesn't have a NIC!The response of AirBNB was simply to reiterate the three options, claiming that its users found reassurance in the ID verification system being in place and as a company, it was seen as a way to combat fraud. I pointed out that if they were so concerned with preventing fraud, then why hadn't they asked me to verify my ID BEFORE TAKING A PAYMENT FROM ME.AirBNB are clearly only interest it taking your money, (not fraud etc). This point was underlined when they emailed me, suggesting that someone else from my group, take up the booking instead.WHAT A BLOODY CHEEK!I raised several issues with the company, including the fact that UK users only have a choice of two forms of ID (not three), but they have repeatedly ignored my queries. indeed, they haven't even acknowledge the points, let alone offer a solution.THIS WAS FIRST EXPERENCE OF TRYING TO USE 'AIRBNB' AND IT WILL BE MY LAST.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

519,Airbnb support confirmed early checkout due to unlivable conditions – then refused refund,"I booked a 5-night stay in Germany through Airbnb. When I arrived, the apartment was in unacceptable condition: cobwebs, visible dirt, dead insects, a musty smell, and loud constant noise from neighboring guests. I documented everything with photos and videos and contacted Airbnb support within 2 hours of check-in.Airbnb support offered me two options:Stay and get a 30% refund for the remaining nightsLeave early and receive a refund for the unused nightsI chose the second option. Airbnb confirmed that I was allowed to check out early, and I left the apartment the next morning before 10:00 a.m. I submitted all relevant documentation and proof.Days later, Airbnb informed me that I would only receive €8.10 — just 10% of a single night — because I ""refused a cleaning offer."" This is misleading. I did not refuse cleaning in principle — I simply declined to let strangers into an apartment I was already occupying. The apartment was not fit for check-in in the first place.Airbnb closed the case, ignored their own communication, and refused further review. The host was also disrespectful, mocking my language and sending voice messages via WhatsApp. Airbnb failed to apply its own guest protection policies (AirCover) and left me with a meaningless refund.This case was handled unprofessionally and irresponsibly. I have now filed a complaint with the German Verbraucherzentrale (consumer protection agency).Update (July 1):After ongoing communication, documentation, and escalation, Airbnb eventually resolved the case fairly. I received a refund for all unused nights and a partial compensation for the first night and cleaning fee. Special thanks to Mostafa S. from Airbnb support, who personally took over and handled the matter with professionalism and genuine care.While I’m grateful for the resolution, it only happened after significant effort and frustration. The standard support flow was disappointing and ineffective.Rating updated to 3 stars to reflect the final outcome and the individual support I received – not the system as a whole.UPDATE: Host posted defamatory review, Airbnb refuses to remove itAfter Airbnb acknowledged my complaint and issued a refund, the host posted a public response falsely accusing me of lying and fabricating evidence. This directly contradicts Airbnb’s own decision in my favor.I followed all Airbnb support instructions to report the review. They told me it would be reviewed by a human, but the system rejected both of my removal attempts automatically — support knew this, yet insisted I try again. When I pointed out the manipulation, they claimed it was “out of their control” and closed the case.The defamatory review remains online. Airbnb allows this to happen, even after admitting the guest was right. Completely unacceptable.Due to this ongoing abuse and dishonesty, I have now permanently changed my rating to 1 star.UPDATE (Juli 19, Final):After weeks of fighting through Airbnb’s endless support loop — involving at least 6 agents, 3 case closures, two rejections of my review removal request (both handled by bots despite promises of human review), and a discrimination report that was dismissed despite clear evidence — I’ve finally received my full refund and had the host’s defamatory review removed.But here’s the catch:This resolution didn’t come from regular Airbnb support. It only happened after I contacted Airbnb’s Data Protection Office and escalated the case beyond their normal channels. Without this step — and the parallel complaints filed through EU consumer bodies — I’m convinced the platform would’ve buried it entirely.It took persistent escalation, documentation, and pressure via external platforms. Without that, none of this would’ve been resolved.This entire process has shown me what Airbnb really is: a host-centric, support-deflecting machine, where guests are left to fight uphill just to be treated fairly. Airbnb support is, in many cases, nothing more than a rotating wall of templates and apologies — absolutely useless without persistence and external visibility.I’m done wasting energy on this toxic swamp.

But our recent experience has made it clear: Airbnb no longer protects guests from false claims, unsafe listings, or abusive charges.After a recent stay, our host submitted a $495 damage claim filled with unsupported accusations — including trash that wasn’t ours, generic “deep cleaning” charges (despite a $150 cleaning fee already paid), and damage that clearly existed before our arrival.One of the central accusations was that we broke a hammock — but we submitted photo proof showing that the ropes were already torn at the moment we arrived, and the first time someone sat in it, it collapsed.That person was injured. Now ask yourself: what if it had been a child? In one of the host’s own photos, a child is seen sitting in that partially broken hammock. If it had failed under a child — would Airbnb still charge us for “causing damage”? Or would they then finally hold the host accountable for unsafe property?We also provided proof that the host themselves asked us to bring in boxes already outside the property — boxes they later claimed were “ours.” Airbnb completely ignored this.Airbnb claims that hosts must provide evidence of damage caused by guests during the reservation. In this case, the host provided no valid timestamps or direct links to our stay, and still — Airbnb charged us.We were told we must pay or our card will be charged. So now, any host can submit unverified accusations, and the guest has to pay. That is a terrifying precedent and a dangerous shift in platform policy.Airbnb, I urge you to reconsider how you evaluate evidence. If this is the level of protection you offer to responsible, long-time guests, we will have to stop using the platform entirely — and warn others to do the same.Last message sent to Airbnb: [28 June 2025], no response as of [1 July 2025].",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
529,Family with Baby Left to Sleep in Car…,"Family with Baby Left to Sleep in Car After Airbnb Booking FailuresA young family returning from holiday was left stranded overnight in their car after a series of Airbnb booking failures left them without accommodation — despite having spent over £1,200 on the platform in a single day.The ordeal began when the family, including their one-year-old daughter, landed back in the UK from Thailand at 7am. Hoping for a smooth transition into their week in London, they promptly booked an Airbnb property nearby for £500. With check-in not allowed until 4pm, the family waited patiently, exhausted after a long-haul journey.But upon arrival at the property, they were shocked by what they encountered. The building’s hallways were cluttered with dirty laundry, broken furniture, and discarded mattresses. Inside the apartment, a foul smell lingered, and stains covered the curtains, sofa, and floors. The accommodation, they said, was clearly unfit for a child.They cancelled immediately, and while Airbnb assured them the £500 would be refunded, the platform advised it could take up to 15 days to process.Still in urgent need of somewhere to stay, the family booked a second Airbnb for £770. However, this booking was instantly cancelled. When the mother contacted Airbnb customer service, she was told the host had cancelled — although the host later confirmed they had never even received the booking details.Now left with two large payments pending and no access to funds, the family pleaded with Airbnb for immediate assistance.“I explained to them that I had no money left to book somewhere else. We were stranded,” said the mother. “They offered me a 20% discount voucher, which was pointless — I had no money left to use it.”After hours on the phone, a customer service agent finally told the mother that Airbnb would provide £500 towards a new booking. She quickly found a suitable property and sent over the details. But three hours later, she received a message stating that Airbnb would not be honouring the promise.By now, it was late in the evening. With no accommodation secured and nowhere else to turn, the family — including their baby — were forced to sleep in their car overnight.“I told them we needed somewhere safe and warm, and that my daughter needed hot water for her bottles. Their final response was simply: ‘We cannot help.’”The mother, who also suffers from fibromyalgia, described the experience as physically and emotionally draining. “It was humiliating and dangerous. We had just returned from a beautiful family holiday, and Airbnb put us in a vulnerable position with a baby — not because of anything we did wrong, but because of their own system errors.”She says she has been a loyal Airbnb user for years, often booking high-value properties for family trips, and never imagined such treatment was possible. “They completely failed us when we needed them the most.”Midnight Call Sparks Further OutrageAdding insult to injury, Airbnb only reached out meaningfully after the mother told them she would be sharing her story with the media.“At around 12am, after everything we’d been through, I received a call from Airbnb — conveniently only after I told them I’d be taking this to the newspapers,” she said. “Where was this urgency when my baby needed somewhere safe to sleep? Why didn’t they act hours earlier when it could’ve actually made a difference?”The family is now demanding accountability from the company, calling on Airbnb to improve its emergency support services — especially for families travelling with young children or people with medical conditions.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I reported everything within hours of arrival with photos, videos, and a full report. The conditions were clearly unsafe and violated Airbnb’s own AirCover policy.And yet — Airbnb support kept stalling. They repeatedly told me the refund was up to the host, even though AirCover is supposed to protect guests regardless of the host’s decision. I had to fight for hours, submit proof over and over, stay awake all night in an unlivable space, and escalate to multiple agents before they finally issued a refund.It should not take this much stress and persistence to get basic guest protections enforced. Airbnb markets safety and “peace of mind,” but they do everything they can to avoid responsibility when something goes wrong.I got my refund in the end — but only after being treated like I was the problem.

537,Customer support has gone so far downhill :(,"Infuriating experience with AirBnB. The host required me to sign a short term lease outside of the platform as part of the registration process - after AirBnB had accepted my reservation. This lease was insanely one sided and included a clause that they could refuse to accommodate me for the night and change the dates without any refund to me. The host refused to issue me a refund when I disagreed with this.This is obviously insanely against AirBnB's policies, so I called support. It was customer support hell for at least 5 hours of my time trying to get the reservation cancelled and refunded. The phone agents literally could not understand what I was saying and refused to look at links to AirBnb's own policies that forbid this. Eventually, their higher level support agent was able to resolve the issue, but this was incredibly draining and took soooo much time.The sad thing is that I used to have great experiences with AirBnB years ago and their phone support used to be some of the best I've ever experienced.

I let that go as thats just the fact some people are short with you. . We arrived with barely a parking spot to get in. He lived there as well. Which we didnt realize. His vehicles were on the right. On the left was numerous old boats, boat trailers , motors & parts laying everywhere. We barely could fit in.. The place had good reviews. We walked in and It was much smaller than it looked. Basically a split level and someone had maybe cut it in half and made an apartment.  It was dark and basement type smell. The bedroom was very small. It was a 2 bedroom. I read too fast and didnt realize there was only 1 bath.  The pool had sand or dirt all around it and floating on it. The patio furniture was all rusted.  The only good thing was it was by the bay. The plave is not as pictured in the add. Anyway we thought we can't stay here. We instantly text and said if we decided to leave would we be refunded. He said yes. If you arent happy I will give all your money back. If you go ahead and leave so I don't have to pay cleaners. I said yes. We left.  Then after we left went to another place.

All apartment doors in the building were left wide open, and our employees felt threatened and highly uncomfortable due to the behavior of other residents. Given the circumstances, we made the immediate and responsible decision to relocate them to a hotel that same evening and booked a new Airbnb the following day.The host, Oliver(Scandi'Nest2 Paris), did not offer any support. We had to relocate to a hotel the same night, and booked a new Airbnb the next day. We shared both receipts with Airbnb as proof.Despite our long-time use of Airbnb for corporate travel and despite the very real safety risk, Airbnb denied our refund request, claiming there was no “proof.”We respectfully find this decision unacceptable.Airbnb’s foremost priority is — and should be — guest safety. In situations where that safety is compromised, even without a specific incident being recorded, guests should not be penalized for acting to protect themselves.We want to emphasize that we have absolutely no incentive to fabricate or exaggerate this experience. We are a loyal Airbnb customer and use the platform regularly for corporate travel. Had we not truly feared for our team’s safety, we would not have canceled the reservation or submitted this request.We are now left with not only the financial loss of the unused night, but also disappointment in how our genuine concern was dismissed. The absence of physical evidence should not outweigh the reality of a threatening atmosphere that any reasonable person would find distressing.We ask that this matter be reviewed again at a higher level, with the understanding that guest safety is not always measurable by photos or reports — sometimes it is simply about feeling secure, which in this case, was clearly absent.Airbnb must take genuine safety concerns seriously — not just when there’s an incident, but when the environment itself presents a clear threat.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

First these two. Then a booking where we arrived and the entire house was beyond dirty and it took them 10 days to come clean, and then another time with a host who wasn’t even allowed to be a host in the complex so we dealt with a lot of angry neighbors. Only once has Airbnb stepped up to help. ONCE‼️Airbnb is turning into a shit show. Find another way of booking because it’s either this or they’ll cancel the booking right before arrival.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
564,Airbnb Protects Rule Breakers,"Airbnb Protects Rule Breakers, Not HostsI’m a host on Airbnb, and my recent experience with their support team was deeply disappointing.A guest booked my property claiming he would be staying with his wife. Instead, he showed up with a friend and another woman — three people instead of two, clearly planning to throw a party, which violates my house rules. I refused to check them in due to the false information.In response, the guest left a negative review that had nothing to do with what actually happened.I contacted Airbnb support to request the removal of this unfair review. For a week, I received nothing but automated responses. Eventually, a representative called me, but their English was extremely difficult to understand. Soon after, my case was closed without any proper explanation.The only answer I received was:“According to our policy, the guest acted appropriately.”So, lying about the number of guests, breaking the rules, and posting a fake review is considered appropriate?As a host, I feel completely unprotected. Airbnb shows no real concern for facts, fairness, or host rights.Their policies are vague, support is unhelpful, and decisions are irrational.This platform no longer feels like a trustworthy place for responsible hosts.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

568,* Traumatic experience in air bnb place,"**Title:** Traumatic experience in Pierrefitte-sur-Seine - Paria  – targeted threat in Airbnb apartmentMy family and I (including three children) stayed in an apartment in **Pierrefitte-sur-Seine**, just outside of Paris, through Airbnb from June 16 to June 18, 2025. On the morning of **June 18**, just before check-out, we were about to leave the apartment when a man and a woman came out of the elevator and approached us in the hallway.They first asked if we were tourists, and then if the apartment was an Airbnb. They claimed to be police officers. I asked for their badges, but instead, **both of them showed us pistols hidden under their clothing** and said they needed to check the terrace.I quickly took my sister-in-law back into the apartment and locked the door as fast as I could. They rang the bell for a while, then eventually left the building. **They only approached our door** – it felt like a targeted encounter.What made it more disturbing: the building was protected by **three secure entrances** that could only be opened with a key or access code. How they gained access remains unclear.**We left the apartment in a state of panic with our children.** Our car was in the underground garage where there was no mobile reception. I was so afraid that I didn't even call the police – I just wanted to get my family out of there as quickly and safely as possible.**Airbnb advised me to write a review and request a refund. I don’t want a refund.** What feels absurd is being expected to write a ""review"" after such a traumatic experience. I reached out to Airbnb so they would **remove this dangerous listing from their platform** to protect other travelers.**But unfortunately, the apartment is still available.** In my opinion, this is **deeply irresponsible** on Airbnb’s part. They are supposed to think about our safety – but they don’t, or at least not enough. After what happened, **how can I trust Airbnb again when this listing remains online?**This is not a complaint in the usual sense – it is a *serious warning*. Please stay alert. Trust your instincts.

A support representative told me I’d be eligible for a 30% refund for the entire reservation — around 20 nights — and advised me to reach back out at the end to claim it. At no point was I told that the only way to receive that refund would be by requesting it directly from the host.Based on this information, I shaped my actions accordingly: I didn’t escalate further, didn’t press the host, and didn’t gather additional proof — trusting that Airbnb would handle it as they said.After my stay ended, Airbnb reversed its position. They refunded me only for 2 nights and told me the rest would be up to the host. This was the first time I heard that the platform would not take responsibility for the full refund they initially promised.If I had been given accurate information, I would have acted differently. Instead, I was misled and denied a fair outcome — not because of what happened in the apartment, but because of how Airbnb handled the situation.Be cautious: the outcome of your case may hinge more on the individual handling it than on any transparent or reliable process.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

One was 4 days before the booking, one was as 1 day before the booking.I spent over 24 hours on the phone to try and find a replacement and left without anywhere for one day, and had to pay an additional £3k for a 2 week booking. The refund policy means they only refund you the cost of the original  booking (and sometimes up to 20% of the additional cost of a new booking). But, at last minute there is naturally nothing available.The second booking cancelled 1 day before, and again we would have to pay more to find anything close to suitable.Any other travel company would look after guests when there is something wrong with the accommodation - book something at the same or better.Air Bnb policies mean you have to pay when a host cancels, and if you’re lucky you might find somewhere else to stay.We didn’t find anywhere to live today, and have been left in the lurch with a refund that will arrive in 3 days.Please don’t ever book air Bnb for any important trips you can’t afford to cancel, or if you aren’t willing and able to cover additional costs for a new booking if your host cancels.I’ve been left in debt of over £3k, lost days and nights of sleep, and now don’t have anywhere for my mother to stay for the next week.This is not acceptable and suggest no one books air Bnb until these policies change - hosts who cancel last minute should be required to cover the additional cost for a new booking the guests agree is the same or better than quality.They suggested my mum stay in a 8 bedroom dorm 6 miles away from me as a replacement.Their current policies when you book and are treated badly by bad hosts, you must cover the cost to fix what they cancel.  Please keep this in mind.Here are the two bookings who cancelled last minute to ensure you avoid them.This host cancelled less than 1 week before a 2 week booking, booked 7 months ago.

That is incredibly misleading and unacceptable for a global platform like this. Users should not have to guess time zones when writing reviews.I work in tech. I know systems can be overridden—don’t insult your users by saying it’s “system generated and no one can change it.” It’s not a technical limitation. It’s a lack of accountability.To make things worse, Airbnb showed no interest in escalating the case or taking responsibility, even though I had proof I was within the window.

This was clearly a cover-up for a place that was grossly misrepresented.We arrived and stayed less than four hours before realizing the accommodation was completely unacceptable. We had no choice but to leave immediately and scramble to find a hotel, wasting our time and money. I spent nearly two weeks arguing with Airbnb’s customer service, and all I got was a pathetic offer of a $100 coupon — which is nothing compared to the $1,100 I paid for a five-night stay. After relentless arguing, they finally offered me $250 in compensation, but that’s an insult given the situation.This company has become a total farce. They no longer care about their customers — only about lining their pockets and protecting hosts at all costs.

Friday 6/6/25, the host first contact came in an hour after check-in, while we were still on the road. I was told the pool would not be available until ""Hopefully"" that Sunday. That meant 2 out of the 3 days booked we could not use the pool, but he would be over in the morning to have it fixed. He also mentioned that the renter before me had the same complaint. That meant he knew the pool was unavailable but failed to notify me, in order to give me the courtesy of finding another place to spend my son's birthday. I tried to wait until the morning, but AirBnb said I would have to pay over $600 for the night in a private pool rental with no pool access. Unfortunately, the home was also not cleaned properly. While the hot tub had smudges of dirt in it and unclean walls and rings on the sink, the other bathroom was shockingly unkept with hair in the drain, filthy shower floor & dirty rugs. There was a smell coming from the garbage disposal and obvious cup rings on the table and counter tops.  When I messaged the host, I could see 1/3 reading it. There was no response for the next hour or so via msg. By the time I got a response they were only concerned with photos. No regard to rectifying the issue I was only told that the host has canceled your rental, leave the property. It was 11 pm after a 12-hour drive. We were exhausted and put out on the streets.

Jason hid behind “policy” and told me to sort it out with Airbnb.Airbnb Support confirmed they spoke to Jason, yet claimed their hands were tied because he “didn’t authorize any change.” In other words, the host blamed Airbnb, Airbnb blamed the host, and I was stuck paying nearly US $200 for a room I never used.Airbnb markets itself as a customer-centric platform, but when a straightforward, good-faith mistake occurs, it provides zero protection or flexibility. Instead of stepping in to resolve an obvious gap in service, Airbnb let rigid policies trump common sense and basic hospitality.After this fiasco I’ve lost all confidence in the brand.

610,Unacceptable and distressing customer service,"Unfortunately our apartment developed a leak during our 5 night stay in Barcelona. This meant the water needed to be switched off at the mains and we would have no running water for showering, toilets etc. We were advised by the host to contact Airbnb about relocating and did so over the phone.After the initial call, the customer service representative, Micheal, communicated via live chat. Michael modified our stay from 5 nights to 1 night, providing a refund for the remaining 4 nights. He informed us that we would be entitled to 20% compensation to help relocate. This seemed reasonable, as we had booked 6 months ago and Barcelona was busy with a number of events, meaning limited affordable accommodation options were available.However, Michael told us 20% would be £99, on a ~£2.5k booking. I questioned this, and he said that the booking had been modified to 1 night and so we were only entitled to compensation for one night. Without any explanation, and without my consent, he had modified the booking in a  way that reduced the compensation due to us. Calling back, a separate customer service agent was much more helpful. By this time it was 8pm and the agent told us we could book hotel accommodation at a cost of one night’s Airbnb +$200, and that they’d be in touch to help provide alternative accommodation in the morning. I read a message to this agent confirming the content of our conversation, which he agreed to, and which I then put into the live chat as a record. Michael disagreed with the information the second agent had provided over the chat, insisting we could not book a hotel and that the maximum compensation would be £99. A third call to Airbnb was made, the agent this time said that both agents were right, but the hotel accommodation would be subject to approval and that was something that she couldn’t do in the phone. She said that Michael had made a mistake by modifying the booking to 1 night but, that now that had been done, he was correct that we were only entitled to 1 night compensation. Although she said this was Airbnb’s mistake, she said there was nothing they could do about it. I asked to speak to a manager. When the manager finally called me back (by this stage nearly 10pm) he was very helpful. We explained the situation and awaited a further call back from him. In the meantime Michael called and insisted we could only get £99 compensation, disregarding the fact this had been escalated above him and that the manager had said they would be able to reach a better solution. We eventually received a call from the manager, who offered a £500 Airbnb voucher, which was slightly more than 20% of the cost of the stay. By this stage it was 11:30pm. Thankfully the host let us stay that night at their apartment (with no water), as relocating at this time of night would be impossible. We were able to find somewhere on booking.com at a reasonable price to relocate for the remaining 3 nights. We now have the Airbnb voucher which we will need to use within 12 months, so I guess it has still cost us money but we can use that for another stay.While the end resolution was acceptable, it was a truly horrible experience. Michael’s behaviour and unwillingness to take accountability for his error in modifying the stay, in a way that reduced the compensation due to us by ~£400, was unacceptable. His attitude was appalling and the experience caused a lot of distress. If the host hadn’t been willing to let us stay, the 23:30 resolution would have left us without accommodation for the night. As it was, staying without water was sub-optimal but at least we had somewhere to sleep. Providing the relocation assistance as an Airbnb voucher, although not entirely unreasonable, significantly reduced the options available to us to relocate with no notice. In the end we paid the extra to book with another provider and will have to use the voucher to recoup that expense on a future trip, despite having zero desire to use Airbnb again after this experience. Sadly based on other reviews, this kind of experience is incredibly common.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
611,En tant qu’hôte Avis négatif sur Airbnb – Hôte profondément déçu,"En tant qu’hôte Airbnb, je suis extrêmement déçu par cette plateforme.À chaque location, j’ai constaté que des objets disparaissaient régulièrement de mon studio, et que d’autres étaient endommagés à la fin des séjours. Malgré mes signalements répétés, aucune mesure concrète n’a été prise.Mais deux cas en particulier ont rendu la situation intenable :Un locataire a pris les clés du logement et ne les a jamais rendues. Airbnb n’a strictement rien fait pour m’assister.Une locataire a gravement endommagé le studio et affirme avoir été agressée par deux individus qui ont aussi volé les clés. Cela a nécessité un changement immédiat de la serrure, et j’ai transmis les factures. Aucune réponse ni remboursement.Airbnb n’a jamais proposé de solution ou même de conseil.Aucun suivi, aucune réactivité, aucune protection. Airbnb ne prend pas ses responsabilités envers les hôtes.Il est clair que ce qui compte pour Airbnb, c’est avant tout leur commission, pas la sécurité ni la satisfaction des hôtes.Résultat : un investissement perdant, une expérience épuisante, et un sentiment d’abandon total.Je déconseille fortement Airbnb à tout hôte qui cherche un minimum de sérieux et de sécurité.Negative review of Airbnb – Deeply disappointed host:As an Airbnb host, I am extremely disappointed with this platform.With each booking, I noticed that items regularly disappeared from my studio, and others were found damaged after guests left. Despite my repeated reports, no concrete action was ever taken.But two specific cases made the situation unbearable:One guest took the keys to the property and never returned them. Airbnb did absolutely nothing to assist me.Another guest severely damaged the studio and claimed she was assaulted by two individuals who also stole the keys. This required an immediate lock change, and I submitted all related invoices. Still, no response and no reimbursement.Airbnb never offered any solution or even advice.No follow-up, no responsiveness, no protection. Airbnb refuses to take responsibility for its hosts.It’s clear that what matters most to Airbnb is their commission—not the safety or satisfaction of their users.In the end, this was a losing investment, a draining experience, and left me with a deep sense of abandonment.I strongly advise against using Airbnb for any host seeking professionalism, security, and real support.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
612,AVOID! 10 Years and over 39 properties - they left me in a dangerous apartment and out of money.,"!AVOID USING IN JAPAN!I have been a customer for 10+ years and purchased 39 Airbnbs. I never once complained about one. I even have 3 more booked already. (These will be the last ones I use)I arrived in an airbnb in Tokyo and immediately noticed the apartment was not clean at all (a lot of dust and dirt everywhere) and had rising damp issues. I read the Airbnb policy and messaged the host. The host ignored me for over 24 hours.I noticed the room felt so damp and also began to notice that my throat was sore and my girlfriend was caughing a lot - when we arrived there were little 'water collection' devices and a dehumidifier running, so the host clearly knew there was an issue.I looked around and searched under posters and saw a lot of black mold and worse and worse damp issues - the apartment was disgusting and the level of black mold is proven to be dangerous to health.I then messaged Airbnb directly explaining the situation and took pictures. They took so long to respond and when they did they didn't really say anything useful, that we had to sleep another night there. In the morning we told Airbnb we would be leaving because we were concerned for our health. No response for OVER 9 HOURS! I had to book a hotel. (the cheapest possible accommodation I could find, because I didn't have R$5000+ extra in my budget, but I would have to spend it)Airbnb had offered no help, no alternative, no money. Eventually after we moved to the hotel, they offered me close to a full refund which I accepted. Only then to hours later tell me they actually would not give me that and had 'made a mistake' and would give me much much less than I paid for the original airbnb and less than it cost me to get the hotel and mainly it would come in Airbnb credits!?I have followed their policy, sent countless photos and explanations, yet now I have paid twice for accommodation at no small cost, due solely to Airbnb's lack of responses and allowing of a dangerous property to be on their website. So now I have lost well over R$5,000 and they are refusing to refund me this money. Not to mention the countless messages, being stuck without properties or knowing what to do all day, having to move about, destroying my vacation - all I asked for was actually in the end less than a full refund! Less! And I still was denied.I'm genuinely shocked, as for such a small cost to Airbnb, they could have prevented losing a long time, frequent customer who has spent hundreds of thousands of reais with them and prevented receiving a lawsuit.It was very clear from talking to the cleaner and seeing how the host was running dehumidifiers (filthy ones by the way) and hiding mold behind posters that the host was very very aware of the mold and damp issues before we got to the property. It now is making me believe that Airbnb may be very aware of this risk too, as the property is still available on their website despite me sending countless photographs as evidence.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

619,"Airbnb Left Me Injured, Stranded in the Rain, and Homeless — Then Lied Twice and Walked Away","Airbnb Left Me Injured, Stranded in the Rain, and Homeless — Then Lied Twice and Walked AwayI had been staying in an Airbnb in Vietnam for two weeks when I was involved in a serious motorbike accident. I suffered a broken foot, broken ribs, and open wounds. While I was at the hospital receiving treatment, the host removed the original mattress and replaced it with the exposed raw latex core from inside a mattress — no cover, no casing, just a slab of rubber.This wasn’t a mistake — it was a deliberate ploy to protect their mattress, clearly intended to avoid damage from my injuries. I was made to feel like a health hazard, not a guest. These latex cores emit formaldehyde, benzene, and other toxic VOCs, and are not safe for direct human contact. I became ill from the fumes and politely asked the host to replace it with a proper mattress again. They were visibly annoyed that I had noticed.Soon after, they began messaging me aggressively, demanding to see my full visa, despite already having photographed my passport and visa stamp as required by Vietnamese law. This was clearly an intimidation tactic. Eventually, a man came to my room, pressuring me to show my visa and suggesting the police would be called. I was on crutches, in pain, alone, and scared. I gave them my visa out of fear. It was now obvious they wanted me out.I contacted Airbnb. I provided full documentation, including photos and medical info. Airbnb support agreed the situation was unacceptable. They promised me a refund via coupon, so I could immediately rebook a new property. That’s the only reason I left — I trusted Airbnb’s word.But as soon as I left the property, Airbnb stonewalled me.I was left stranded on the street for 9 hours, during rainy season, with:•	Exposed wounds•	A broken foot and cracked ribs•	Crutches•	5 heavy bags of belongingsI had nowhere to go, and the promised coupon had not been added to my account. I messaged Airbnb repeatedly. No one responded. I was abandoned in a foreign country while seriously injured, soaking wet, humiliated, and completely unsupported. I had to borrow money just to get a hotel for the night — and that was only the beginning.Two days later, I got through to Airbnb again. They apologised, said the refund had now been initiated as cash instead of a coupon, and offered partial compensation for my hotel stay. They told me it would arrive in 5–15 working days.But then — they backtracked again. Within hours, I received another message saying Airbnb would not refund me or compensate me at all, falsely claiming I had “chosen” to leave the property. That directly contradicts their own written instructions.I am now six days into this nightmare, completely drained — physically, financially, and emotionally. I still have injuries. I’ve had to borrow money to survive, and I’m once again facing homelessness until payday — entirely because I believed Airbnb’s word and acted in good faith.Airbnb’s conduct has been:•	Cruel•	Deceptive•	Psychologically abusive•	And a complete violation of duty of careThey treated me like a problem to be removed, not a human being in need. They made promises, watched me act on them, and then cut me off the moment it was no longer convenient. They left me on the street in a medical crisis.I am pursuing legal and regulatory complaints through UK, EU, and Vietnamese channels. I have full documentation — screenshots, receipts, chat logs, photos — and I won’t stop until they are held accountable.If you’re injured, vulnerable, or traveling alone — do not trust Airbnb.

621,This was my last booking with them.,"Not sure what's going on with Airbnb, but this is the last time I'm using them.Out of the last three bookings I made, two were canceled last minute. LAST MINUTE. Here's how Airbnb handled it:Sure, I understand that things can go wrong and cancellations can happen from time to time. But the real issue here is how Airbnb handles these situations.First of all, you can’t leave an honest review for an accommodation that cancels on you last minute. I want to warn others about my experience. Why is Airbnb protecting the host and not being TRANSPARENT? Where is the option to leave a review for a place that completely screwed me over?The money left my account, the transaction happened, so why am I not allowed to share my experience? This is a question for Airbnb.Second, they clearly do not care about your situation.The latest cancellation happened in a location where, unless you book in advance, you end up paying more than double the normal rate.So here I am, arriving with my 5-year-old daughter in front of the accommodation, only to be met with a ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" and a useless €30 credit for a new booking. I had to urgently find another place, pay double the price, and ended up being late for work.In this case, I expected Airbnb to at least cover the difference I had to pay. But of course, their policy doesn’t work that way. Their policy is to screw you over.Then at around 11 PM, one of their so-called ""expert"" support agents contacts me to suggest three listings I might consider and apologizes for the situation.

When we checked in, we realized that the host has given fraudulent information about the property, such as distance to the beach and Mall, amenities etc. The host was lying about everything. We had to leave the property and requested for refund to Airbnb, but got no reply after several attempts. All I got was auto reply.

650,Account blocked without explanation — left stranded and unsupported abroad,"I am a Ukrainian citizen who has been living in different countries due to the war, including Canada and Ukraine. I had relied on Airbnb for several years without any issues — I even received humanitarian housing support from them in 2022.Recently, my account was suddenly deactivated without any clear explanation after I tried to book a short stay using a Ukrainian bank card that I had used before. I had verified my identity, provided my Ukrainian passport, Canadian address, and submitted two valid bank cards under my name.After the deactivation, I was left without accommodation abroad, unable to contact my host or manage my existing bookings. Airbnb only sent vague, automated responses and refused to explain what rule I had supposedly broken.I wrote a detailed and respectful letter asking for a proper review, but received another copy-paste message saying my account would stay deactivated — permanently.This caused significant emotional stress and travel disruption. It made me feel completely unsafe and unsupported in a vulnerable situation. I feel like I’ve been unfairly targeted simply for using two valid cards or for moving between countries.Airbnb claims to support displaced people, but this experience made me feel the opposite — ignored, flagged, and excluded by a system that offers no humanity or transparency.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I reported these issues to Airbnb with videos and photos and received partial compensation.But after the host was notified of my complaint, she falsely accused me of stealing a remote control and posted a negative review full of personal attacks, dismissing my experience. Despite my final appeal and strong evidence of retaliation, Airbnb refused to remove the review.I am a respectful guest with a clean record who only stayed a few hours during a layover. This review has damaged my reputation and Airbnb closed the case without proper protection.

655,Airbnb Is Protecting Fraudulent Hosts and Exploiting Guests — Unethical & Infuriating,"I’m absolutely disgusted and angry with how Airbnb has handled my recent experience. I booked a stay where the host locked me out in the heat, failed to provide a working key, and repeatedly invaded my privacy by constantly coming outside and watching me — making me feel harassed and racially profiled.Out of courtesy and empathy (because they had children), I chose not to file a complaint at the time. Huge mistake.After I checked out, the host falsely accused me of smoking marijuana inside the home (not true), left a retaliatory and defamatory review on my profile, and filed a fraudulent damage claim against me for a so-called “smoke odor” and cleaning costs — which are, in reality, the host’s responsibility between guests.Airbnb’s response? They demanded $211 for “cleaning,” refused to show me any real evidence, cited “confidentiality,” and pressured me to pay within 24 hours, threatening my account. They ignored everything I provided about the host’s misconduct, refused to remove the false review, and dismissed my concerns entirely.This company sides with lying hosts to avoid using their insurance and makes guests pay for costs they should never be responsible for. When I requested fairness, they offered to reduce the charge if I paid quickly — essentially a shakedown.To make things worse, when I asked for proof of damages, receipts, or inspection records, Airbnb repeatedly refused. I even told them the host’s husband kicked in the door to let us in after we were locked out, yet that somehow didn’t matter.Let’s be real: Airbnb has created a system where guests are vulnerable, blamed, and exploited, while dishonest hosts are protected and rewarded. I have no trust left in this platform. It’s unethical, manipulative, and fraudulent.Shame on Airbnb.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

It was even verified in an internal message we had together on air b n b. Due to the situation I had to cancel the booking and find somewhere else. I was advised to contact the host first, which I did and as it was the evening I did not expect her to resolve it until the morning. I stated this in a text message and showcased it to air b n b. The host agreed to a refund in the morning and I left to another place. I then get the most awful review on my air b n b profile that includes completely false information about me and the experience. The host accused me of not paying (which is impossible because you cannot book a place without paying) , tht I got angry with her in the night because she didnt reply, which was also not the case as we had amicable messages and as Id already explained I didn't expect her to respond until the morning. I contacted Air b n b to get the review rebuked because it goes against policy to have false information in a review.

663,Review of AirB&B,"Review of AirB&B: A Deep Disappointment After Years of LoyaltyI had been a long-time and loyal user of AirB&B. With over 20 trips around the world under my belt, the service had always left a positive impression. Not only did I use it myself, but I also recommended it to friends, acquaintances, and in my blog with over 3,000 subscribers. I trusted AirB&B because I believed that even in a difficult situation, they would have my back. And in the past, they did — during trips to Venice and the US, when accommodations turned out to be uninhabitable, the AirB&B team always found a solution quickly and covered the cost difference for new accommodation.However, my experience in Paris in May 2025 was a real shock and disappointment.I planned to celebrate my birthday on May 28 in Paris with my mom and friends. Two months in advance, I had booked what I thought was a great place. But on the day of check-in, everything went wrong. The host didn’t respond to my messages or calls. I was only able to reach him through AirB&B’s support team. When we finally entered the apartment, we were horrified: it was dirty, there were holes in the walls and furniture, vomit stains on the floor, and no clean bedding. The host offered us used sheets with visible hair on them, insisting they were “fresh.” The apartment was booked for three people, but for the third guest, all he provided was a thin blanket — no pillow, no proper bedding.Wires were hanging out of the walls, and the bathroom was in a disgusting condition.I contacted AirB&B support and sent photos, explaining everything in detail. And what did I get in return? A voucher for 20% off my next booking. No real help. I was told to find a new place on my own, pay for it out of pocket, and wait up to five days for a refund of the ruined booking. The problem was — I didn’t have enough money available to do that, especially in one of Europe’s most expensive cities. After several calls with support, the only thing they could offer was a voucher worth 50% of the original booking. That was it. I was left standing in the street with my mom and our luggage on my birthday.Luckily, I managed to find a last-minute alternative — it was twice as expensive, but at least it was clean and functional. Out of ten hosts I contacted, only one responded. I nearly ended up spending the night outside, with my mom, in Paris, on my birthday.So what’s the takeaway? I am extremely disappointed. While the support agents were polite and sympathetic, they were completely powerless and unable to help. The quality of service from AirB&B has significantly declined. They no longer offer the safety and support that used to set them apart. I will no longer use this service, and I absolutely won’t recommend it to others. Fortunately, there are now many other platforms to find accommodation.I hope my experience helps other travelers avoid this kind of situation, save their nerves and money, and not end up stranded in a foreign city on a special day.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

672,Airbnb Charges You Before Payment Is Due – Breaching UK Consumer Law,"I was shocked to find Airbnb charging my card for upcoming bookings a full week before payment was actually due — even though the hosts’ policies clearly allow free cancellation up to 24 hours before check-in.This isn’t just poor practice — it’s deceptive, coercive, and potentially unlawful under UK consumer protection law. Specifically, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 prohibit charging for services before a legal obligation exists. Airbnb’s “charge now, refund later” approach ignores your cancellation rights and shifts the financial risk onto you.Moreover, the card Airbnb used for the charge was only used once for a reservation fee and was never designated as a stored or default payment method on my Airbnb account. My Airbnb profile explicitly lists a different card as the authorised and stored payment method. Yet Airbnb used a card I used for a one-off payment without my consent.When I raised the above issues, Airbnb kept using arguments irrelevant to my complaints (e.g. but you're eligible for a refund anyway) and completely ignored the not authorised card issue.Airbnb clearly knows better. For a company this size to flout basic consumer protections is unacceptable. I’ve filed a complaint with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and urge others facing similar practices to do the same.I expected more from a platform that claims to empower guests. Instead, I got a forced transaction based on terms that hadn’t even taken effect yet.Be warned: Airbnb may charge you before your booking  is even due and use payment methods you never consented to — and against their own stated rules.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Some listings are overrated because guests feel uncomfortable giving anything less than 5 stars, even when the stay was average. I’ve even experienced hosts offering small gifts or guilt-tripping messages to “earn” that perfect score.Airbnb should consider a fairer system, like a Net Promoter Score (NPS), where guests anonymously share whether they’d recommend a place.

It was a weekend I hadn’t realised had become unblocked - as soon as I realised I spoke to the guest. But Airbnb requires the host to cancel in this situation - and this is quite costly both financially and in terms of superhost. I have an average 4.95 rating and have never cancelled. And of course I would have honoured the guest if the booking was within two to three months. But six months is ample to find an alternative space. Airbnb charges me $85 which is a quarter of the payout I’d have received. I also lose superhost status as they only allow cancellation rate of 1 per cent. Which as a new space and only 20 bookings in six months - will take me YEARS to regain.Guest doesn’t get the fee as compensation. Airbnb does!Also just seems unfair when they actively encourage you to have flexible cancellation policies for guests.And while I understand it can’t be the same flexibility for hosts - I think there should be some scope for cancellations beyond a reasonable time frame.Tried to contact Airbnb got not response.Same thing happened when I tried messaging them once with a genuine security concern of a guest turning up - who was messaging me from a profile that was not the same on the booking.

In reality:•	I proactively offered to pay in person•	I reiterated the offer via message•	I paid the full €50 she requested through Airbnb — even though Airbnb later told me I wasn’t required to pay at allThe tone of the host’s messages after checkout was friendly, even thanking us — until we questioned vague extra charges. Only then did her language become erratic and personal. The retaliatory review was posted after I disengaged from the accusations.Airbnb refused to remove the review, despite their own policies against retaliation and false claims.

This company should be banned! First they were forced to move me one month ago, when I rented a place that has nothing to do with the beautiful pictures. It was a war and they just made the decision when I was in danger. Gave them one more chance, and guess what? I'm literally staying in a place with cockroaches running up and down, a huge infestation, but that's ""not a problem"" according to their customer service.

749,A Nightmare Experience with Airbnb – Broken Promises and Abysmal Support,"My recent experience with Airbnb has been nothing short of a nightmare, marked by unprofessional hosts, deceptive practices, and a complete lack of accountability from Airbnb’s support team. What was supposed to be a family holiday in London turned into a stressful ordeal that left us stranded, humiliated, and financially burdened.Check-In Chaos and Misleading ListingsUpon arriving at our booked property in Canary Wharf, we waited outside for an hour with heavy luggage. The host’s representative, Vanessa, arrived late, forgot the keys, and later provided malfunctioning access to the building. When we finally entered, we discovered ongoing maintenance work—tools, workers’ belongings, and debris littered the living area and kitchen. This critical detail was never disclosed in the listing, despite the host’s later contradictory claims. When confronted, the host, Rossorio, became hostile, accused us of rudeness, and demanded we leave immediately.Airbnb’s “Support” – Empty Promises and GaslightingDesperate for help, I contacted Airbnb support multiple times. While agents initially promised compensation (verbally agreeing to £75 for expenses and a partial refund), these commitments vanished in writing. Instead, I received generic responses citing “host policies” and a refusal to honor verbal assurances. Worse, when I tried rebooking, Airbnb flagged me as an “unauthorized party,” blocking new reservations without explanation.Financial Loss and BetrayalDespite agreeing to a £35 cancellation fee for an upcoming reservation, Airbnb deducted £65 without justification. The promised £75 compensation for our ordeal also never materialized. In total, I’m out £105 due to Airbnb’s mismanagement. Their final response? A cold, copy-pasted link to cancellation policies and a dismissive “case closed” message.A Pattern of NegligenceEach support agent contradicted the last, forcing me to relive the trauma repeatedly. Commitments made over calls were denied in writing, exposing a systemic disregard for customer trust. Meanwhile, hosts like Rossorio face no consequences for blatant dishonesty, while guests bear the brunt of Airbnb’s lax oversight.Final Advice: Avoid AirbnbAfter this ordeal, I booked a hotel via Booking.com effortlessly. Airbnb, however, left my family stranded, stressed, and out of pocket. Their platform prioritizes hosts over guests, and their support team specializes in empty apologies, not solutions.Proceed with caution – unless you enjoy false promises, financial disputes, and hours wasted arguing with unresponsive “support.” Airbnb has lost a customer for life.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Airbnb often issues partial refunds without your consent, and sometimes even full refunds within cancellation windows—regardless of circumstances. While the platform does a great job of getting your listing seen and booked, don’t expect a fair resolution when conflicts arise. As for retaliatory reviews?

The lack of responsive and helpful support is simply unacceptable.Additionally, the recent website redesign is a step backward. The new layout is confusing, cumbersome, and far more complex than the previous version. If something works well, why change it?

My recent booking for a weekend getaway was canceled due to what Airbnb claimed was a payment issue. The truth? My credit card had recently expired, and Airbnb made no effort to update the info, even though their own Terms of Service (2.4) say they can obtain updated details from my bank. No such attempt was made.Worse, they only notified me via email—which landed in spam. No messages through the Airbnb app, no texts, no calls. For a time-sensitive issue like this, relying solely on email is outdated and irresponsible—especially when their app is the primary way they communicate for everything else.I had a scheduled call with a case manager, which Airbnb completely mishandled. Instead of calling at the agreed 10:00 AM time, they tried to reach me at 1:00 AM (!), then closed my case when I didn’t answer. I had to spend a day and a half on the phone with multiple reps trying to sort it out—no resolution, just frustration.Even more baffling: they had a working card on file that had been charged successfully just two days earlier for another booking, yet never attempted to use it.In the end, the host—who had nothing to do with the issue—graciously issued a full refund, despite having to take a loss in profits for having to reduce the rental costs for a last minute booking.  Airbnb offered nothing. Because of their failure, three friends and I lost our accommodation, and $800 in nonrefundable event tickets. This was a trip we’d looked forward to all year, and I even took time off work for it. We missed it all.Airbnb needs to review and update their policy regarding expired cards.

After the first several days, we were getting consistent bookings until one day. We got a booking on dates that we had blocked out on the calendar on the Airbnb site, which caused a conflict and no matter how we communicated to the people that were seeking the reservation, we were unable to contact the people, whether it was a problem through Airbnb or the people ignoring the message.The first time it was stated by the customer service on Airbnb that we had a switch turned on that allowed for automatic confirmation of bookings, which I explicitly had gone into the settings and turned off and when I explained it to them, they said that they wanted to go into the settings with me and turn it off while we were on the phone to be certain that it doesn’t occur again And that’s exactly what we did.After receiving numerous notifications of confirmations that we had not made, we contacted the company again and they told us it was an internal error and that they would correct the situation however, it will eventually cause us to have very low ratings and not be able to rent our apartment through Airbnb and they took no interest in that part of my concern.The next thing that I was trying to address was when I ask what country my call to Airbnb is being transferred to they flat out refuse, even though it’s very obvious that it is being routed through India, of which they refuse to admit that the call is going to India and they claim that they’re not allowed to tell us which is against the United States laws that they must tell The person who requests where the call is being routed by US law, but they continue to refuse.I have found in my short time that Airbnb does not care about the people who host on their site. They care about getting their money from their cut of the reservations and they redirect our calls through India even though many times the people on the phone from India are very in polite and do not listen and they talk through you and refuse to answer questions.It is becoming very very evident that I must list my apartment, which is very very nicely furnished, and everyone is overly happy with our hospitality, and I must list it dozens of other places because Airbnb has fallen off.

Imagine being unable to leave a building in an emergency.I eventually received a refund, but Airbnb allowed the host to post a false and defamatory review, accusing me of intentionally locking myself in to avoid paying. This is not only absurd — it’s blatant victim-blaming. I requested Airbnb remove the review under their own policies (which prohibit false and retaliatory comments), but they’ve failed to act.Worse still, the property is still listed — meaning other guests could be put at risk. Airbnb talks a big game about guest safety, but my experience shows how easily they let hosts get away with dangerous conditions and dishonest conduct, even when reported.This experience has completely destroyed my trust in Airbnb.

The host arranged for a cleaner to come weekly. We checked out on April 1, and while packing to leave the country, we discovered cash missing from three different wallets stored in separate places inside the apartment:•	My wallet (in my backpack in the living room) had foreign currencies I’d collected over years—worth ~$100.•	My wife’s wallet (hidden in her bag in the bedroom) had 200 euros, a gift from her sister after our baby was born.•	A change wallet, visible in the living room, had a $5 note with symbolic value.We didn’t use these wallets during the trip—we relied on Apple Pay and credit cards—so we only realized the money was gone when we started packing.No one had access to the unit except the host’s cleaner, who last visited on March 30. We contacted the host—no help. Airbnb support—no help. Then I filed a BBB complaint.Airbnb responded to the BBB multiple times saying I was “working with a specialized support team,” but I had not received a single message. After I followed up again, I was finally contacted over a week later—only to be told to “be patient.”The most frustrating part? Airbnb refuses to let me leave a review because their system only allows 14 days after checkout—even though the theft was only discovered after we left.I’m not asking for a refund—just to share my experience honestly so others can protect themselves.

I am afraid to leave a negative review when we leave because it is well known that hosts also review guests. If you leave a bad review you will get a bad review. The problem? You don't know you are getting a bad review and cannot defend yourself.There is only a short window of time to leave your review, so they know exactly who left it. There is no anonymity.We paid good money for a whole house with a fenced in yard to stay with our two dogs, which are better behaved than most kids these days, and this place is a dump. Despite contacting the host directly to confirm that the yard is completely fenced in and receiving a confirmation of that fact, as soon as we got here, before even getting in the house, our one dog went behind the garage and around it and freely walked out and took a three hour tour of Erie, PA, including a swim in the bay to chase the ducks and geese.The bay is several miles from the house and he crossed several busy streets. He could have been killed and could possibly have killed or injured people driving who would likely swerve to avoid hitting him and there's nothing funny about that.(And, yes, we did check out the fence before letting him off lead. We couldn't get behind the garage to the other side and it looked to be closed off from our vantage point.)The house is filled with furniture out of Goodwill. Actually the furniture at Goodwill is probably better. They listed minimum rules on the website and then there was a whole list on the fridge when we got here-including taking the garbage out and placing it on the curb the evening we arrived. No, not our garbage. There are holes in the ceilings and the walls that have been patched poorly. There is a big hole in the bedroom ceiling patched with bare plywood.I could go and on, but you get the point. Coffee included.

827,A Heartbreaking Experience with OYO…,"A Heartbreaking Experience with OYO Rooms & Airbnb – A Night No One DeservesWe had booked an OYO room on Stade Street, Kent (CT21 6DT, UK) a week in advance through Airbnb, trusting both brands to deliver a safe and reliable stay. What we experienced was the complete opposite – a night of stress, fear, and abandonment that no human being, especially a pregnant woman, should ever have to endure.Due to traffic and unavoidable delays, we arrived late — around 1:30 AM — only to be told over the phone by someone claiming to be from OYO that we couldn't check in because the hotel only accepts check-ins until 11 PM. We were shocked. We were literally just around the corner, exhausted, and hoping for some rest — especially with my wife being 8 months pregnant.Instead, we were told we had to pay an additional £50 to check in. Reluctantly, I agreed, just wanting to get my wife into a warm bed. But then, after holding the line for 20 minutes, they claimed they couldn't reach the reception — essentially admitting there was no one there. The £50 fee felt like nothing more than a tactic, with no real intention of helping us.I even got out of the car and knocked at the hotel door, hoping someone might respond. No one did. My pregnant wife and I stood helpless on an empty street, in the dead of night, cold and alone.Airbnb was no better. I called them, explained the situation, and they said they would reach out to OYO and get back to us within 30 minutes. No one called. I called again. Nothing. Two major companies that promise safety, comfort, and support failed us completely when we needed them most.We waited outside for nearly two hours — in disbelief, in fear, and in utter emotional exhaustion.What makes it worse is knowing that OYO's founder built his company after he once faced a similar experience, locked out of a hotel himself. That pain inspired him to build a brand that would never let anyone else go through that again. But last night, we went through the exact same pain. Only now, his brand – which started with heart – has become unrecognizable.This was not just poor service. It was a failure of compassion, of duty, and of the very values these companies claim to represent.We will never book with OYO again. And for the first time, we’re questioning our trust in Airbnb too. A place to sleep at night is a basic human need. And on this night, that need was cruelly denied.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Recently, a guest caused considerable damage to my caravan. I submitted a reimbursement request through Airbnb with photographic evidence provided by a professional third-party cleaning team.In response, the guest left a false and retaliatory review, claiming I was rude, that the property was in poor condition, and that I fabricated the damage. None of these issues were mentioned during or immediately after the stay—only after the reimbursement request was submitted.Despite providing Airbnb with clear message history disproving the guest’s claims, they refused to remove the review. Even more disappointing was the rude and abrupt attitude I received from Airbnb support staff on the phone. The senior case manager spoke to me with a ""couldn’t care less"" attitude and offered no valid reason for allowing the review to stand.Airbnb’s Review Policy supposedly prohibits retaliatory or misleading reviews, but in reality, they do not protect their hosts—even when the evidence is clear.Prospective hosts, be warned: Airbnb will not support you when a guest leaves a defamatory or retaliatory review. You're on your own.Update 11th MayDue to my multiple complaints to AirBnB as they wouldn't explain how the guest's review met their policy guidelines in retaliatory content I submitted a subject access request to get to the bottom of it myself. Within a few hours of submitting this request AirBnB removed my listing.I'm now letting through Vrbo and Direct Holiday Homes.

831,"£31,000 payment demand 10 months in advance and then dreadful support service! is Found the perfect for our holiday…","Found the perfect house for our holiday in Florida for Feb 2026. The booking was for 29 days at a cost of around £30,000. Upon booking the Airbnb system asked for full payment in advance. Yes that's £31,000 in full at least 10 months before the booking date! Of course I was happy to pay a material deposit of 50% but expected to pay the remaining 50% nearer the start date like every other booking I've made with Airbnb. I contacted Customer support who told me it was their policy to demand full payment if the booking is over 28days!!So, I wondered where my £30,000 paid to Airbnb would reside for 10 months and why I should lose out on any interest that such an amount may earn during that 10 month period if it was not sat in Airbnb's bank!

832,refund promise refund promise broken – Airbnb leaves host stranded,"I’ve been a reliable and well-rated Airbnb host for years. On Easter Sunday, a guest asked to check in much earlier than allowed. I clearly confirmed the regular check-in time (3pm) via Airbnb messages.Despite this, the guest canceled. Shortly afterward, an Airbnb support agent called me directly and told me I’d receive a full payout if I agreed not to rebook the apartment for that period. I agreed – and I kept the place blocked.Now, weeks later, I’m told I won’t be paid because I was “unreachable.”That is simply untrue. I responded via Airbnb AND WhatsApp. I have full proof of communication.I’ve requested escalation to a case manager or supervisor multiple times – no response, just generic replies.This is a breach of trust and a broken verbal agreement from Airbnb’s side.As a host, I feel abandoned and misled – despite having done everything right.I hope Airbnb will take responsibility and provide a resolution. If not, I will escalate this case further – legally and publicly.If anyone has had similar experiences with Airbnb, feel free to reach out.

833,Awful Customer Support – Completely Unreliable in Critical Situations,"I’ve had two deeply disappointing and unacceptable experiences with Airbnb’s customer support that have completely destroyed my trust in the platform.The first situation occurred during a trip to Morocco. The listing I had booked turned out to be a nightmare — there was no Wi-Fi as advertised, ongoing noisy reconstruction work, and the place was extremely dirty. I couldn’t stay there, so I contacted Airbnb support expecting help. Instead, I was passed from one representative to another in endless back-to-back calls that lasted the entire day. They kept “looking into it” but never actually did anything. I was left without a place to stay in the middle of the night. No emergency listing. No help. Just exhaustion, stress, and frustration. This alone was enough to make me question the reliability of the platform.The second experience was even more disturbing. I recently reported a host who replied to guest reviews with racist comments — a clear violation of Airbnb’s policies. In addition, I experienced serious health issues and even personal attacks during my stay, all of which I documented in detail and submitted to Airbnb. Despite this, they didn’t take any action for two days. Their only response was to repeatedly ask me vague questions like “How can we assist you?” even though I had already provided detailed context and documentation. They have access to the full chat history, know exactly what happened, and yet chose to delay and ignore rather than act.Airbnb clearly has the tools and data to respond quickly, but instead chooses to stall and deflect. This isn’t just poor customer service — it’s outright negligence, especially when guest safety and well-being are at stake.I will never use Airbnb again. There are alternative platforms out there with responsive and responsible support teams. If you’re tempted by slightly cheaper listings, remember that you’re also gambling with your safety and peace of mind. For me, it’s simply not worth the risk.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Despite reporting the incident to Airbnb and requesting a refund for the remaining nights, our request was denied — and my account was unfairly suspended without clear explanation.We were the ones placed in a threatening and unsafe situation, yet Airbnb offered no real support or protection.

The host was responsive, but when we arrived, we were shocked by the condition: dust all over appliances, food stains embedded into furniture, and even leftover food on the countertops. We paid a cleaning fee, yet the host suggested sending a cleaner during our stay, which we refused—why should we be inconvenienced for a mistake that should never have happened?We took photos and left a fair 4-star review (despite the condition) because the host was new to Airbnb. In return, we were accused of extortion—the host submitted doctored, fraudulent evidence claiming we demanded money to delete our review. This was completely false. We had zero communication with the host outside of Airbnb, and we have full proof of this.Airbnb accepted the fraudulent evidence without verifying it. Even worse, they confirmed the alleged conversation happened outside their platform, raising a terrifying question: How did the host get our private phone number? Airbnb is supposed to protect guest information, yet our number was clearly accessed, spoofed, or worse—used to fabricate a false narrative against us.Despite our repeated attempts to provide evidence disproving the host’s claims, Airbnb refused to help and took the host’s side. They dismissed our concerns, ignored the potential identity theft, and essentially allowed a host to get away with criminal activity.This is not just about a bad stay—this is about Airbnb enabling fraud, negligence, and security violations. If a host can forge evidence and Airbnb doesn’t have the tools or willingness to detect that, EVERY guest is at risk.The host’s name: Sk Ali. Be warned—there may be more like him. Airbnb clearly does not do forensic verification of screenshots or claims, and they clearly don’t have a proper security or fraud investigation team.Airbnb is failing to protect its guests.

I immediately contacted the host and Airbnb, followed all the right steps, and ended up relocating to a hotel at my own expense.Even though I provided tons of documentation (hotel confirmations, messages, everything they asked for), Airbnb ultimately refused to help reimburse me — even though I had to completely drain my hotel points to rebook safely and quickly. Their final response basically boiled down to: “Sorry, we can’t help you because you used points.”It’s really disappointing to realize that even when you prioritize your safety and do everything you’re supposed to do, Airbnb doesn’t truly stand behind their guests.

The guest who booked our home had already received a review for similar behaviour from another host but yet was deemed by AirBnB as being of suitable calibre to book again with another host.When I tried to claim the costs of damages from Airbnb’s AirCover scheme they made it as difficult as possible - asking for receipts of kitchen equipment that was installed 10 years ago, asking me to explain how the damage was done (when the guests were consuming drugs and I wasn’t there) and informing me they would not cover the cost replacing the locks after the guests took the house keys.  It seemed their safety policy allows guests like this to retain keys to properties that they have taken drugs at and trashed, which in my view represents a huge safety issue.I appreciate that incidents do occur and that they are often unexpected.  But how they are recovered is also important.  In this situation I felt completely abandoned by AirBnB.  They were more interested in wrapping layers or bureaucracy around the process, providing non genuine statements of support and in closing down the case regardless of whether it was resolved or not.Their behaviour has been appalling and has confirmed to me that they really do not care about either hosts or guests.If you have a rental property, think carefully about whether you want Airbnb to be your broker.

She was elderly, clearly unwell — emotionally and mentally — and completely overwhelmed. Her communication was erratic, and her behavior became unpredictable. I trusted my instincts and left early, for my own safety.But what shocked me most? Airbnb did nothing.I reported everything in detail. They treated it like a standard support case, closed it quietly, and left her listing live. No follow-up. No accountability.Yes, I was the guest at risk. But this is about more than one booking.This woman should not be hosting strangers. She’s struggling — and continuing to host puts everyone in danger: the guests, but also her. She could be manipulated, harmed, or trigger a serious incident. Airbnb’s inaction isn’t just careless — it’s irresponsible.Airbnb talks a lot about “trust and safety,” but where’s the empathy?Not just for travelers — but for hosts who clearly need support, not five-star pressure.This isn’t a rant. It’s a wake-up call.Safety isn’t just about locks and listings. Sometimes, the most compassionate — and most responsible — thing a platform can do is say: This host needs care, not a new guest.(And yes, I tried to post this in r/Airbnb. I got banned.

Loud, daily thumping noises made it nearly impossible to work or rest.Airbnb’s “Aircover” failed me. They offered no real relocation help and now threaten to withhold refund eligibility because I “chose to stay” — as if I had other options while traveling with dogs and belongings, and no replacement was provided.Despite a BBB complaint, photos, and proof that the listing remains falsely advertised, Airbnb continues to downplay the severity and shift the blame. Even on Easter Sunday, they sent messages attempting to limit refunds and close the case — rather than resolve it.I’m putting this out publicly because no one should be stranded or gaslit like this by a global platform.

884,last-MINUTE-canceled by host,"This is a review towards AirBnbs customerservice and their guest-HOSTILE-policies/guidelines.My last experience with AirBnb briefly summarized:* When guests last-minute-cancels/no show, they lose all their money.* When host last-minute-cancels without prior notice, they get a strike and a small penalty-fee. The guests bear all the additional expenses related to the cancellation by their host.Longer version:Unfortunately my last booking got cancelled at last minute by my host, that happend when I've already arrived at their destination/doorstep. I informed them about my arrival, and the only response I received from the host right before the cancellation, was their short apology and that they ""THOUGHT"" they have informed me the day before about the cancellation.This was by far the most disgusting behaviour I have ever faced, absolutely lack of respect of others. Iam shocked how AirBnb allows such trash of a human being able to operate on their platform. Due to the cancellation, I was also unable to leave a ""HONEST"" review of this host. (This again makes me suspicious if many of the reviews on AirBnB truly are inflated, as it seems negativity are mostly being avoided.)Took some time to finally reach customerservice and i did express the frustration about the whole situation. Customerservice agents kept responding with automated generated nonsense about how ""sorry"" they were for my inconvenience, a full refund being issued, host getting a strike/penalty, etc. They also insisted on phone-calls, but I demanded all dialogue to be in written form just for the sake of documentation.After 7-8 hours of contact and threats of reporting AirBnb, they eventuelly gave in with an additional 50% compensation on top of the full refund. But in exchange I wasted one full day of my vacation.With all that being said, 95% of my experiences on AirBnb has been positive. Most of the people I've met are truly honest, kind and hard-working.Sadly, I'll refrain myself using this platform until they provide customer-protection against hosts who last-minute-cancels WITHOUT assisting guest in search for alternatives.

Whereas I can sympathise, such a blanket and judgemental stance is unacceptable, and when it is found out, it ought to be called out. I called AirBNB as I had a message to say a “Refund” MAY be on its way. I raised the issue of money being taken from my account when the Host never intended to take my booking in the first place – ‘false pretence’ in my book – and asked what steps could be taken to ensure others wouldn’t be subjected to the same experience. I suggested that those who did not want to receive bookings from people without reviews should have it written on their profile, saving people from wasting time and expense. The Call Handler was simply disinterested – nothing would be done. I asked to speak to the supervisor and was told one would call “within 40 minutes”; no call was ever received. If Airbnb Call Handlers make it up as they go along – lie in other people’s terms – how can we trust those who provide accommodation to do any better?

I booked a property in New Orleans back in January for a late April stay. At the time of booking, the listing had no reviews, but the host had solid reviews on other properties, so I trusted it.In February, a new review appeared saying the apartment was dirty and UNSAFE. I also noticed that the listing was misleading, claiming the location was within walking distance to bars and restaurants—but the times listed were clearly for driving. I tried reaching out to the host to express my concerns, but never received a response.The host’s cancellation policy only allowed a 50% refund, but given the new review and misleading description, I contacted Airbnb directly to request a full refund.Over the course of several days, I had 13 separate phone calls with Airbnb support, spending over 2 hours explaining the situation repeatedly because no one seemed to read the case history. It was frustrating, but I kept following the process in good faith.Finally, on Thursday, April 17th at 18:46, an Airbnb representative told me—on a recorded call—that I would be receiving a full refund, and even offered to help me rebook a new place. Based on that, I booked another Airbnb later that same night.Then, at 1:23AM on Saturday, while I was asleep, I received a message from Airbnb saying I would not be getting a full refund after all!!!This kind of inconsistency and lack of accountability from customer support is absolutely unacceptable. I followed every step, trusted Airbnb’s word, and acted in good faith—and now they have gone back on their word and I’m stuck paying for it!Airbnb has lost my trust, and I strongly urge others to think twice before booking.

We raised several serious issues already on Monday – it is now Thursday (17/4-25), and nothing has been resolved. We were first told to wait for the host to contact us. Then we were told to contact the host ourselves. And so it has continued – a frustrating game of ping-pong. We are leaving on Sunday, and it’s clear that no one is taking responsibility.The problems with the apartment are numerous and severe:The front door cannot be properly secured – it only has a sliding bolt at the top. The windows also don’t lock. We do not feel safe.There is a brothel in the same building, and the women working there frequently gather in front of the entrance, shouting and causing disturbances at night. This disrupts our sleep and creates a highly uncomfortable atmosphere.The listing describes the apartment as “quiet and cozy” – this is grossly misleading.The apartment is supposedly equipped for 8 guests, yet there are only 6 chairs and a ridiculous small extendable table.Many of the basic amenities listed were missing upon arrival (shampoo, soap, cleaning cloth, trash bags).Numerous things are broken or in poor condition: the balcony door, blackout blinds, toilet seat, bathroom sink, kitchen cabinets, the TV (which receives no channels), and the WiFi doesn’t reach all the rooms.There is no hot water – we have had to boil water in order to shower.When we used the washing machine, sewage water leaked from an unsealed pipe under in the kitchen resulting the whole apparent to stink of feces.The apartment is dirty and reeks of cigarette smoke despite all windows being closed.The registration of our guests has not been completed correctly, despite my attempts to resolve it with the hosts.We requested a refund and a relocation to another apartment on Tuesday – yet by today, Thursday, the matter is still unresolved.The listing of the apartment in Airbnb is wildly inaccurate and completely misrepresents the true state of the property.

918,Booking made without my knowledge:  Airbnb refused to refund monies,"Airbnb nightmare:  Booking made without my consent   $1200 taken. Airbnb refuse to provide refund nor the details of who booked or device it was booked on etc, despite my pleas *o do so.I went to check my bank account Saturday morning as I have been away a granddaughter who is seriously ill, on the Sunshine Coast.Imagine my shock and horror when seeing a much higher balance owing than there should have been  - $1200 in fact.  Quickly saw the problem - an AirBnB booking I had never made - I havent touched Airbnb for 10 months and that $1200 'stolen' out of my account not authorised by me, is needed for medical interventions not available in Australia.After reporting the issue to ANZ bank, and cancelling my card, they told me to contact Airbnb to see what had happened to get my money back.Well there upon, the joke began - but the joke (and theft) is on me.  AirBnB are shocking and that is too kind a description.  Their customer service is rotten to the core and after trying to find which took hours, they were abysmal.  Flimsy.  Not appropriate at all for a massive institution handling mega funds.First of all I could not understand them.  I asked them to slow down.  The first one just would not, seemingly deliberately making it hard for me.Airbnb's thin pretense of a problem solving complaints department is most certainly not that. just an excuse for one. I had to tell the person I did not understand what the problem was, and that I required a snap shots of who made the booking, time, on what device, messages between host and the person impersonating me.AirBnb said their protocol was a reviewer would contact me when able and give me a decision.  I told them I was not even home at the time of booking but in hospital with my GD who is unresponsive in episodes and that I wear a bum bag around my waist 24 hours so as not to lose or misplace my phone and credit card.The condescending review came back from some one called Leon to say he could find no evidence of interference and I'd basically have to wear the $1200.  End of.  Goodbye.  With no avenue to right of reply or request for further information as these reviews are done by some flimsy phantom entity on no reply emails.   OMG.  ShockingFor the next few hours I sort to get back to reconnect with another reviewer which eventually happened but same response as with Leon.  Washed their hands of me.  I have again been told sorry, you are  not entitled, your bad, basically that someone in   your household must have got hold of your account.  Then goodbye, Airbnb is closing the case and recourse, no more to be heard.  If I report to the issue to police, they  provided a link.   Left hanging like a shag on a rock- excuse my language.How condescending and rude, AirBnb.  You have stolen my money in my book and refuse to provide  me the pathway I have requested showing how whenand where plus what device, this booking was made.  They just ignore my request so I have no way of establishing how this happened, and if it could happen again.  Disgusting almost fraudulent manner of handling peoples money and bookings.  Airbnb stated that the host didnt provide refunds. However when I spoke to the host, she said Airbnb would sure refund the deposit.  So Airbnb is indulging in midleading behavior.  I believe Australia needs to do a full review of Airbnb business practices. as it is clearly substandard and allowed to handle enormous amounts of money.Lesson to be learned:1. remove your credit card from Airbnb site and only install when booking2. Dont trust Airbnb, check your accounts regularly for unauthorised activity on your accountsdid get hold of the host and they were lovely but while I asked, whether rightly or wrongly if they could see their way clear to refunding the almost $1200 paid already, I have had no response but prior to my request, they did say they felt positive Airbnb would refund the $1200 deposit.However in one of the reviewers responses, he stated that the host did not provide refunds, whereas the host in a message said they believed Airbnb would refund my monies taken without my knowledge or consent.

922,Beware of the “golden badge on Airbnb,"Beware of the “golden badge on Airbnb: my experience as a host with 4 propertiesI used to trust Airbnb’s algorithm that assigns the well-known golden badge to listings marked as “guest favorites,” with a percentage showing how they rank compared to others. As a traveler, I often picked listings based on that badge, thinking it was a reliable sign of quality.But now, as a host with years of experience and four different properties listed on the platform, I’ve started to question it—and honestly, I’ve changed my mind.My best-performing listing, a beautiful apartment with a sea view, high-end interiors, an amazing location, glowing 5-star reviews, and a consistently high booking rate… no longer has the golden badge.Meanwhile, my other listings— beautiful as well, same location, same place, in a top position as well, but less popular, no sea view, —still have the badge. This has led me to a simple but disappointing conclusion: the algorithm is not reliable.As someone who manages multiple listings, I’ve been able to compare them directly, and I can confidently say that whether or not a listing has the badge doesn’t always reflect its actual quality or guest satisfaction.MY ADVICE as an experienced host:Don’t rely on the GOLDEN  badge to choose your vacation stay.Always read real REVIEWS, look at the photos, check the details of the home, and pay attention to how the host communicates.The algorithm can be wrong.

Hosting has never just been a business to me — it’s something I’ve poured my heart, time, and care into.Unfortunately, my recent experience with Airbnb Support has left me feeling completely disheartened.A guest left a poor review on my listing after a rare, temporary water issue in my town — an external problem entirely beyond my control, which affected many homes in the area. I reached out to Airbnb, not to silence the guest, but to ask for understanding, fairness, and at the very least the chance to update my response to the review professionally.Instead, I was met with rigid, robotic responses, no empathy, and even received a warning threatening suspension from the platform if I receive another low-star review — despite the fact that I have a long, proven track record of excellent hosting. Shockingly, they referenced a 3-star review from last September, completely ignoring the countless 5-star reviews I’ve worked hard to earn.This experience has made me feel that Airbnb no longer values its hosts as people — only as numbers on a screen. There was no kindness, no consideration of the circumstances, and no support for someone who has given years of loyal service to their platform.My hope in writing this review is that Airbnb reflects on how they treat their hosts — especially those who genuinely care and take pride in creating beautiful guest experiences.We deserve to feel valued, supported, and treated with fairness — not fear.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2

927,Airbnb Allowed a Retaliatory Review to Stay,"Airbnb Allowed a Retaliatory, Misleading Review to Stay—Despite Clear Evidence. Hosts Beware.Hey fellow Hosts,I wanted to share an experience that I believe speaks to a larger issue in how Airbnb handles unfair reviews—and how helpless we can be, even when we follow all the right steps.A recent guest left me a retaliatory and completely misleading review after I reported legitimate issues with their behavior during their stay. I submitted clear evidence showing the review was written solely in retaliation, which is explicitly against Airbnb’s own Review Policy (Article 546). Yet, despite multiple attempts to dispute it, Airbnb not only refused to remove the review but closed my case with vague, copy-pasted replies and no proper explanation.Here’s what I was told:> “The case is now closed… we do not have a way to override it… we appreciate your understanding.”No, I don’t understand—and I won’t quietly accept it.Their “specialized team” never addressed how the review didn’t violate their retaliation or misleading content policy. They simply dismissed it and shut down further appeal.I’ve now started preparing to escalate this externally—to the press, watchdog groups, and online communities—because I believe this case reflects a serious flaw in how Airbnb protects (or fails to protect) its Hosts. If they won’t uphold their own policies, what are we even agreeing to as Hosts?If this has happened to you, please speak up. We need transparency, accountability, and a review system that doesn’t allow bad actors to damage our reputations with impunity.Happy to share the full details privately if anyone is interested—or wants to join forces to get Host voices heard.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

932,Significant Safety and Support Concerns with Airbnb,"I recently had a deeply troubling experience during my Airbnb stay in Strasbourg, which has profoundly affected my view of the platform’s commitment to safety and proper host vetting. Below is a summary of my experience:Host Background Checks: The incident underscored a significant flaw in Airbnb's processes—specifically, the absence of comprehensive background checks for hosts. The host displayed erratic and abusive behavior, possibly worsened by untreated health or mental health issues, significantly compromising my safety and comfort.Host Behavior and Eviction: The problems started when the host entered my room without permission after I complained about the lack of adequate heating in the apartment. The situation escalated rapidly, culminating in my being unfairly and abruptly asked to leave the property without any justified reason.Airbnb’s Response: Although Airbnb covered the costs for three nights at a hotel, they did not provide a true refund for the turmoil caused. Moreover, they allowed the host to remain active on the platform, despite clear signs of potentially dangerous behavior.Financial and Emotional Impact: Airbnb's resolution did not fully alleviate the financial burden or the emotional distress I suffered. The urgency of finding emergency accommodations added substantial stress during an already challenging period.Lack of Accountability: Airbnb’s management of the issue revealed a disturbing disregard for serious misconduct by the host. It seemed their main concern was to avoid legal responsibility, rather than to offer real support to the affected guests.Conclusion and Caution to Others: This ordeal has led me to question the reliability of Airbnb for secure accommodations. Prospective guests should be aware of the risks associated with inadequately vetted hosts, particularly regarding their mental and physical health.This experience is a stark reminder for anyone using Airbnb about the inherent risks of the platform. Airbnb needs to enhance its host vetting procedures and accept greater responsibility for guest safety to avoid similar incidents in the future.When you agree to use Airbnb, you essentially accept all risks involved, as the platform does not conduct thorough background checks on hosts. This means a host could potentially have a criminal record and still maintain an active profile on Airbnb.These are the terms of AirBnb -3.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 9), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you.

939,Disappointed in Airbnb’s Lack of Guest Protection,"Title: Disappointed in Airbnb’s Lack of Guest ProtectionI recently had a really frustrating experience with Airbnb that left me feeling completely unprotected as a guest. The apartment I booked was not clean on arrival — crumbs on the floor, sticky spots, hygiene issues in the bathroom, and missing amenities that were clearly listed. I messaged the host right away, and while she was polite, she insisted her cleaner had been there and said, “This has never happened before,” which felt more like dismissal than accountability.I followed all the proper channels: I documented everything, explained why I couldn’t report within 72 hours (I was alone in a foreign country and afraid I’d be left without housing), and even cleaned the space myself. When I submitted a partial refund request, Airbnb responded by saying it was entirely up to the host to approve — meaning that even if a listing doesn’t match reality, guests have no real protection unless the host agrees to take responsibility.Airbnb claims to support guests, but this experience showed me otherwise. It feels like there’s no meaningful process in place when a stay goes wrong — and no consequences for misleading listings or poor conditions. I didn’t want a full refund, just a fair one. Instead, I was left feeling dismissed, unsupported, and out of options.If Airbnb truly wants to be a trusted platform, it needs to take guest reports seriously and have systems in place that don’t rely solely on the goodwill of hosts.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
940,Extremely Disappointing Experience with Airbnb – Lack of Support and Host Negligence,"My experience with Airbnb and the host of an apartment in Curitiba Brazil!!! was extremely negative and disappointing. What should have been a relaxing stay turned into a nightmare.Upon arriving at the property, I noticed serious safety issues: the apartment, located on the 15th floor, had no window screens, which posed a significant risk, especially since I was sick and accompanied by my young grandson. When I asked the host to install window screens, he responded insensitively and negligently, saying he raised his daughter in the same environment and ""nothing happened."" This was irresponsible and disrespectful of my safety and that of other guests.Additionally, the advertised single bed was not suitable; it was actually a low children's bed, something the host admitted but minimized. Despite not using the apartment even for a single night, the host refused to refund the full amount and insisted I pay 50% of the stay.The worst part was the lack of support from Airbnb. I had to resolve the dispute with the help of my bank, as Airbnb did nothing to assist me. Furthermore, the host changed the listing after my complaint, adding the information about the lack of window screens, which was never mentioned in the original listing. This clearly shows an attempt to hide flaws after the fact.Today, I am no longer seeking a refund, as my bank handled the situation. What I really want is to report this kind of behavior so that other guests don’t go through the same ordeal.Warning to everyone: If you're booking with Airbnb, carefully check reviews and be prepared to deal with the platform's lack of support.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

The listing read:“Free cancellation for 48 hours.

Only after trying to cancel (five days in advance) did we learn it actually meant 48 hours after booking. This deceptive wording is not the host’s doing — it’s Airbnb’s platform design.Airbnb refused to take responsibility, falling back on technical fine print and ignoring the misleading nature of the language. Its support claimed we “had the option” to read the full policy. However, the listing wording gave us no reason to think that was necessary. It created a false sense of flexibility and led us to believe we were within our rights to cancel.As longtime users of the platform, we’re deeply disappointed by this lack of transparency and customer support.We’re sharing this to help others avoid the same experience — and to hold Airbnb accountable for what we believe amounts to misleading advertising.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

One feature, apparently, is that when you search for an accommodation and send a booking request, the property later reappears in the search results. Now, the same property shows as unavailable for the dates you're looking for. Naturally, you think the host has later marked the property as unavailable. However, it's actually Airbnb that continues to suggest this property to the user.I personally experienced this when I thought the property was unavailable and began searching for an alternative, which I found and booked. Almost simultaneously, the host of the first property confirmed the booking, and suddenly, I had two accommodations booked. It was impossible to explain this situation to customer support.""The accessibility of the support is very poor. Firstly, the people only speak broken German or English, whichever it may be. Reliable callbacks are offered, but they do not happen. What makes me suspicious is that on the answering machine, it is mentioned that I will be contacted by a member of Airbnb. It should be correct to say that employees are being mentioned, not members—what’s the deal with that?""It's sad that such a large company uses these methods to improve quarterly results and present itself better to investors.""The support is almost impossible to reach, the staff doesn't speak the language, and they don't follow through with their promise to call back after they’ve looked into the issue.

958,Message to all guests from a super host. DON’T BOOK ON THIS PLATFORM,I am a superhost on Airbnb. Last year on a new property I listed I received an early review of a 3 from a guest who retaliated to my requests that they keep the after hours noise down for fellow residents in the building (it’s a no-party unit so no excuse).Part of the review stated a “dirty stairwell with excessive dust” for the communal stairs and gave a 2 for cleaning! I’ve been a host for 8 years and my places are spotless.Airbnb ignored my protest and request to remove the review.ALL SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS ON THIS APARTMENT HAVE SCORED ME A 5* rating so I was absolutely horrified to be told last week by Airbnb that my listing will be REMOVED on May 2nd because I got a 3* review last year 😳 😱I immediately appealed and took screenshots of all the subsequent excellent reviews. To no avail. I’ve been advised they will “uphold” their decision and remove my listing.I have 42 guests who have booked with me between now and September - I now have to create a new listing on booking.com and try to get the guests to trust me and move across. I still have the property and still have the ability to host … it’s ridiculous!If you are a guest reading this DONT BOOK ON THIS PLATFORM.

961,Awful company,"Awful company. The host of the place I booked for my 30th birthday cancelled 3 weeks after accepting as they wanted more money (we had booked 2 days over the May bank holiday weekend originally but she comes back as says she needs to offer it to people who can stay over the full 3 days). This is 3 weeks after confirming our booking and we had prepared everything for our trip. The host told Air B & B that they couldn't have us stay because the property was under maintenance but we have a message from the host which clearly states she needs a booking over the full 3 days and not 2. We rang Air B&B and spent over an hour trying to raise a complaint to be put on hold over and over again, as they hoped we would hang up. We eventually managed to speak to a 'manager' who said the call was recorded for training and monitoring purposes. When we responded saying we are also recording the call, they quickly hung up the phone as they know they weren't complying with the correct complaint process. We then requested a full refund for the trip, but were instead given air b and b credits with a petty £32 compensation which doesn't even cover the train tickets my friends bought to get to the house. We have never dealt with such an unprofessional company in our entire lives and will never use this company ever again. And now we have less than 2 months left to try and organise a 30th birthday for 16 people which has caused a huge amount of time and distress.

965,"Traumatizing, Discriminatory Experience & Zero Accountability from Airbnb","I’m sharing this in the hope that no one else has to go through what I experienced. I was forcibly removed from this property based on false and discriminatory accusations made by the host and building manager. The manager called the police, who conducted a public stop-and-search. Despite the humiliation and anxiety this caused, I cooperated fully. The police found no drugs, no rule-breaking, and confirmed there was no evidence of any wrongdoing.I followed all the house rules. Yet I was publicly accused, humiliated, and evicted. What’s worse is that I was the only guest targeted—despite the smell of cannabis throughout the property and other white, elderly guests staying at the same time. They were never questioned. I was singled out, and I firmly believe this was because I am a young Black woman. The treatment I received was discriminatory, dehumanizing, and completely unjust.To make matters worse, Airbnb canceled my reservation shortly after the police left—without ever contacting me for my side of the story. I was left without accommodation at short notice, no support, no rebooking help, and no offer of care or protection under their AirCover policy.I paid for 16 nights, stayed for only 9, and despite being entitled to a refund, I have not been refunded the remaining amount—over £1,000. Airbnb has yet to contact me directly or provide a full resolution, despite multiple attempts on my end and clear documentation proving I did nothing wrong.This has been a deeply traumatic experience. I trusted Airbnb to provide a safe, fair service and uphold its policies. Instead, I was met with silence, discrimination, and abandonment.I’m speaking up because this kind of mistreatment and lack of accountability should never happen—especially on a platform that claims to care about guest safety and inclusion.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

After two days, we discovered small bugs in the bed. On the third day, after a quick Google search, it became clear: bedbugs.We immediately informed the host. Our vacation was ruined – we simply couldn’t continue. We also contacted Airbnb support right away, reporting an active bedbug infestation. The result? A small refund for the affected stay – but all other costs were left entirely up to us.I brought the bedbugs back home with me and had to hire a professional exterminator, which cost over €500. On top of that, I tried countless anti-bedbug treatments while waiting for the exterminator appointment. I had to pay for all of this myself. Airbnb only covers a small amount for laundry – that’s it. They won’t take responsibility for anything else.I had never dealt with bedbugs before and was completely overwhelmed. Airbnb later claimed that I should’ve undressed outside and sealed everything immediately for cleaning – but they never gave me any of this advice, not even when I first reported the issue. We were left to deal with it all on our own.Airbnb provides no hygiene guarantee and takes no real responsibility for the hosts on their platform.No support. No solution. No proper communication.

971,Airbnb Double-Charged Service Fees and Refused,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Airbnb's refund policy and customer service that I feel compelled to share.I had to cancel a 5-night reservation after the full refund window but before the 50% refund deadline. The host graciously offered to refund me once the dates were rebooked, stating: ""I can refund you once the days are rebooked. You would receive the difference if our price ended up being lower.""Based on this promise, I immediately canceled my reservation to give the host maximum time to rebook (rather than waiting until the 50% refund deadline which would have guaranteed me a partial refund).When the dates were rebooked, multiple issues arose:1. The host claimed one date wasn't rebooked despite Airbnb's system showing it as unavailable2. The refund calculation suggested an unusually low rebooking rate with no transparency3. Most importantly, Airbnb collected service fees TWICE for the same property on the same dates - once from me and once from the new guestDespite multiple polite requests to Airbnb support explaining this double-charging issue, they repeatedly refused to refund even the service fee portion (approximately $250), citing rigid policy adherence while ignoring the fundamental unfairness of collecting fees twice for the same dates.Airbnb's unwillingness to address this obvious case of double-dipping on service fees has permanently damaged my trust in their platform. I've been a loyal customer for years but will be exploring alternatives for future travel.Beware of Airbnb's refund policies - even when a host agrees to refund you based on rebooking, Airbnb will still keep all their service fees, essentially profiting twice from the same reservation dates.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

975,Slapped with a 41% extra fee and told to accept or cancel,"I booked an apartment through Airbnb in January for a stay in April. Then, out of nowhere in March, the host messaged me saying they “made a calculation error” and increased the price by 234€—from 560€ to 794€. That’s a 41% increase, after the booking was confirmed and paid for.I contacted Airbnb support expecting help. Instead, I got told to either “accept the new price or cancel.” That’s it. No protection. No real recourse.I had to dig through Airbnb’s own host policies, which clearly say that once a booking is made, the price can’t be changed unless the guest agrees—and if the guest refuses, the host is expected to cancel. So why did the whole issue get pushed on to me instead of the host?Airbnb offered me a 20% discount on the price difference (only the difference!!) if I rebooked elsewhere in their application—meaning I still get to pay more, just a bit less more. That’s not compensation, that’s a joke.To make matters worse, when I tried to leave feedback about this support experience, the review link had conveniently expired by the time I got my refund. And of course, I couldn’t review the host either, because I didn’t end up staying—even though I wanted to.This platform protects its hosts, not its guests.

But within the first two weeks, four different sets of neighbors were able to unlock my private apartment door using their Airbnb-issued digital app (AKILES system).Yes—four different sets of strangers were given access to my home by the Airbnb host. And Airbnb is perfectly okay with this.One group entered in the middle of the night while I was asleep. I was lucky—my service dog barked and scared them away. The others opened the door during the day, believing the apartment was theirs—because the app told them so.Airbnb gave the same access link to multiple guests.My apartment became a garage sale labeled “take anything you want.”No cameras. No lock changes. No accountability from the host or Airbnb.I was terrified to leave for days. I had to stay on lockdown inside the apartment and place a heavy suitcase behind the door at night, afraid someone else would enter again.I have multiple sclerosis—and stress worsens my condition.This situation was nothing but stress, fear, and complete insecurity.Every single time I reported an incident, they told me the issue was “fixed.” They even sent screenshots. So I went to the latest neighbor and asked him to test it.Guess what? He opened my door. Again. I filmed it.And what does Airbnb offer me now?•	Not a proper relocation.•	Not a real solution.•	No apology. No compensation.Instead, they offer 1–3 nights in a hotel (paid upfront by me), or 7 nights in another Airbnb (also paid upfront by me).Let that sink in:They want me to PAY AGAIN, upfront.Let me be clear:•	I already paid for 4 weeks.•	I only “enjoyed” 2 of them—if you can call it that.•	I still have 2 weeks left, already paid and unused.•	And Airbnb wants me to pay again to be relocated.How is that not a scam?They refuse to take responsibility.They gaslight—sending copy-pasted replies like “we’re sorry you feel that way,” while ignoring every piece of evidence I’ve provided.They have video evidence, screenshots, and a full chat log showing they allowed unauthorized entries and still failed to protect me, my health, my service dog, and my belongings.This is not customer service.This is not a “misunderstanding.”This is corporate negligence, discrimination, gaslighting, and a total failure to protect the safety and rights of their guests. And it is illegal, because they allowed strangers to repeatedly break into my rental.Airbnb: You endangered me. You endangered my service dog. You violated my privacy.

It felt like they automatically sided with the host instead of conducting a fair and balanced review of both sides.As a long-time customer, I expected Airbnb to protect honest feedback, not silence it without giving me a real chance to explain.

1002,I booked a long-term stay via Airbnb,"I booked a long-term stay via Airbnb, expecting a livable, peaceful space as described. What I got was unbearable: nonstop noise in the shared living room, loud TV and music until 3AM and from 8AM again. There was no mention of this situation in the listing when I booked. After my complaint, the listing was quietly edited to include “noise potential,” which was not visible in my booking view – clear manipulation. Airbnb support has been a nightmare: I provided video proof, screenshots, and detailed explanations – yet I was asked the same questions over and over, forced to repeat myself, and pushed to cancel my own booking without any written guarantee of a refund. I refused to be tricked into giving up my rights. On top of that, I couldn’t even access the apartment for the first 3 days due to severe flooding and a cyclone – roads were closed, Ubers canceled. I was forced to find emergency accommodation. Airbnb showed no understanding. I am exhausted, financially at risk, and emotionally drained. I am still waiting for justice and a refund. No guest should go through this. Airbnb has failed to take responsibility – and the way they treat guests is shameful.1. Unannounced and severe noise disturbance:The listing described the accommodation as peaceful. It explicitly stated “No Parties,” and there was no warning about increased noise levels or it being a “student accommodation.”In reality, a roughly 50-year-old flatmate was constantly present in the shared living area, playing loud TV and music for hours — often until 3:00 AM, and starting again around 8:00 AM. Sleep was impossible.This situation was not disclosed in the original listing and only added later (“Noise Potential”) — which I can clearly prove with timestamped screenshots.2. Airbnb’s massive failure and contradictory handling:I reached out to Airbnb support multiple times and submitted substantial evidence (including a video recording of the noise, screenshots, and a full written timeline).Despite that, I was repeatedly ignored, pressured, and not given any clear confirmation. They advised me to cancel the booking myself — without any written assurance of a refund. This is unacceptable, especially since I am clearly entitled to a refund due to the defects in service.3. Natural disaster – property was inaccessible for 3 days:For the first three days of my booking, I was unable to even access the property. A cyclone and heavy flooding hit the area. Roads were officially declared impassable, and my Uber driver could not get through.I had to book an emergency accommodation, which I can prove via receipts, news articles, and Uber logs.This makes it clear that I paid for a service that could not be used, through no fault of my own.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Well, she parked in the main driveway and was asked to relocate her car and that apparently made her feel unsafe and like she had no privacy. Or how about the construction workers that said they had four when my Airbnb specifically said it fits two comfortably or 4 if you’re in a pinch and then they brought eight people who disrupted my tenants tore up my yard and broke all my stuff. But Airbnb didn’t care about that. Although I did get the $20 back for the broken curtain rod, but not the four additional people two additional trucks and all the other damage. or how about the old people that came took all of the lighting fixtures off the walls and said I needed more lighting and rated me a two on cleanliness because they didn’t have a washer and dryer and felt that it needed to be updated. It needed to be updated. You had a stove and oven and everything that you need to live there except a washer and dryer. Let’s not forget the pictures and the square footage are all in the listing. On top of that, guests we’re paying two to $300 more for their taxes and fees and then guests are getting mad at me saying I’m expensive. I unlisted my property after only three months, two drug baggies (different guests) and two people who lied about who was staying. It gives people like me who travel and don’t wanna stay at a hotel, a bad rep.As far as staying at an Airbnb, I have stayed at five different locations. The first one was wonderful, but other guests have ruined it so it’s not listed anymore.

The renter went so far as to google stock me, found out the name of my business, which has nothing to do with Airbnb and wrote a fake One star review for my business. Yet somehow, Airbnb doesn’t think she’s retaliating. I have three listings with Airbnb, 285 reviews, of which 99% of them are excellent and I’ve been with them for nine years.

1017,Very poor show and disregard from AirBnB from a guest perspective.,"Beware of fraudulent Hosts. Beware of AirBnB's tone of voice and stance (in my experience) regarding fraudulent Host damage claims lodged against the guest. Stayed for a few nights in an apartment in Milton Keynes with its own private underground parking. On arrival the apartment was in a sub standard condition with black marks on walls, scratch on TV screen, loose plug outlet. Loads of defects. Took pictures but due to busy schedule didn't have time to report or insist on a change of apartment. Some 3 hours or so after vacating the host falsely accuses me of damage and supplies similar pictures and submits a claim via AirBnB claims for £300. So we now have a strong case of misrepresentation as the advert showed a pristine apartment and a strong case of false accusation. Then ensued a lengthy back and forth via email with AirBnB in me proving my innocence. The fact I had pictures and could prove when these where taken could leave no doubt of the false accusations. Interesting fact is that AirBnB paid the Host from their own insurance and told me that was due to my fantastic record with them over 9 years, but I need to read the guest terms again. So in my experience a very poor show and disregard from AirBnB from a guest perspective. Oh and just over a month later I received a car park fine for displaying a photocopied permit, which was provided by the host. Appealed and the fine was cancelled.

I followed all the proper procedures:✔️ Filed a police report immediately✔️ Reported the incident to Airbnb✔️ Provided all supporting evidence, including security footage and building security failuresInstead of helping me, Airbnb permanently suspended my account, blaming me for the crime I suffered. They wrongly classified my case as a violation of their policies, despite me being the victim, not the perpetrator.I appealed the decision, explaining that:I was not aware that the criminals were involved with drugs.I never participated in or facilitated any illegal activity—I was the target of a premeditated robbery.The building security failed, allowing the criminals to leave unescorted, which was out of my control.Despite all this, Airbnb refused to reconsider and closed my account permanently without a valid reason.

Airbnb uses AI to automatically reject review removal requests, making it nearly impossible to challenge unfair feedback.

1040,BAD AIRBNB!,"BAD AIRBNB!My host cancelled with less than 48 hours to go. This was nice house at Cudjoe Key, near Key West. We had airline tickets, and thousands of dollars of activities paid for, and my granddaughters were ready to go, so I had to find something else. Well, Key West is a super hot spot for Spring Break. Airbnb offered to help and then suggested three alternative rentals: one would have cost me an additional $15,000, one was $10,000 more, and the last one was a trailer--a trailer! So, I found and equivalent house. It was $3000 more, which is pretty amazing for Key West during Spring Break. Airbnb only gave me $873.52, so I was out of pocket $2214.13 to get the new rental. I told them that it wasn't fair and they should cover the full amount...but I would be happy splitting it with them. They refused. IN MY OPINION THAT IS NOT FAIR. I reserved an paid for a house...I should get one for the money I paid.BAD AIRBNB!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1043,Deeply Disappointed by Airbnb’s Inflexibility During a Family Medical,"We booked an Airbnb on September 2, 2024, for a planned family vacation scheduled for July 12–19, 2025. Sadly, just two weeks after booking, my mother suffered a seizure and was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor—a devastating and aggressive condition.While we initially hoped she’d still be able to make the trip after surgery and treatment, her condition worsened. My father canceled the reservation on February 24, 2025—well within the host’s posted policy, which stated cancellations made by July 5, 2025 would receive a 50% refund of nightly rates and cleaning fees.Since we had only paid 50% of the total cost ($6,213.82), we expected a refund of that amount. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.The host, Tory, was unwilling to work with us. My father offered medical documentation—she declined. She originally said we’d receive a full refund, then later claimed she was unaware that Airbnb’s payment plan policy overrides her posted cancellation terms. Eventually, she said we’d only get a refund if she’s able to rebook the week—no guarantee, just a conditional promise.We were then told by Airbnb that because we used a payment plan, we were not eligible for any refund, despite canceling well in advance and within the stated policy window.I spent over two hours on the phone with a kind and empathetic customer service manager, who admitted our situation warranted a refund. But he ultimately said he couldn’t issue one due to internal policy restrictions.This experience revealed a serious flaw in Airbnb’s system: there is no clear, compassionate process for families dealing with real emergencies—even when the host’s terms suggest otherwise.Instead of support, we were met with rigid policies, conflicting information, and a host who changed her story. We’re not asking for special treatment—just basic fairness and human decency. Airbnb failed us when we needed compassion the most.I’ve reached out directly to Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky in hopes that he’ll step in and do the right thing for our family.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

However, the review still has not been removed.According to the new policy, only a team called the ""Special Team"" can handle such cases. However, there is no direct way to contact them. They only provide a form link, and despite submitting it multiple times and informing them about it, I keep receiving the same generic response.

I cannot review the host, and while AIRBNB states that it will “cost the host”, that have no consideration for the person who has been cancelled.

I had a guest who decided to take off his trousers and insisted on staying, even when I needed to assess the situation because of a burst pipe caused by the dry season. Although Airbnb offered him the option to relocate, he felt there wasn't enough communication from their side.In the end, I made the decision to cancel his reservation, which I felt was the right choice.Unfortunately, this isn’t the first bump in the road I've faced. During Covid, I had a guest who left quite a mess, and while I received only $80 in compensation, I was faced with potential repercussions myself.

Our Villa is sold out all summer mostly by Airbnb but many bookings are 2 or 3 weeks so we don’t meet their target! 5* or not, (we actually had 5* on all our properties until we sold them short while ago) we no longer qualify.

In the meantime we had people knocking on our window as we drove, didn’t want to roll the window down, also didn’t want to make them mad. Couldn’t just “drive away” as we had to drive slower than we could walk because of the DEEP pot holes in the narrow roads. We didn’t end up hearing back from ABB until the next morning. We ended up sleeping in our car, in a parking lot, in a third world country. They never did assist us in finding a different place. We did find one for our last night.

After this, the guest’s tone completely changed—they falsely accused me of racism and even implied they would steal from my apartment.

Airbnb should protect experienced hosts who follow the rules, not punish them for doing what Airbnb itself recommends.If you’re a host considering Airbnb, be aware: they will not protect you.

No proof of damage: We repeatedly asked for time-stamped photos or other conclusive evidence that we caused the alleged damage, but Airbnb failed to provide anything substantial.2.	We already paid $2,228 for our 3-night stay at a rate higher than the market price – This included a $140 cleaning fee, yet Airbnb still attempted to charge us an additional $100 for “extra cleaning.” This seems like an unfair way to double-charge guests.3.	Zero fair dispute process – Airbnb’s dispute system is one-sided. Guests are held liable without real evidence, and once Airbnb makes a decision, there is no proper way to appeal or escalate the case.4.	Stressful, biased & unethical practices – Airbnb clearly favors the hosts over guests throughout the process. This experience has caused significant emotional and physical stress as we have been forced to fight an unfair charge instead of enjoying our trip. Airbnb’s handling of this has made us question their customer service and trustworthiness.Beware Before Booking on Airbnb!•	If a host falsely claims damage, Airbnb may automatically charge you without proof.•	Even if you dispute it, Airbnb’s system is stacked against guests.•	Their customer service offers no real recourse—once they decide, they ignore guest complaints.We will not use Airbnb again unless they change their policies to protect guests from false or unfair charges. If you’re considering booking, be aware that you could be held liable for damages without evidence or a fair process to defend yourself.We strongly urge Airbnb to:✔ Stop charging guests without sufficient proof.✔ Revise their dispute process to allow fair appeals.✔ Provide better transparency in damage claims.If you’re reading this, think twice before booking on Airbnb!

Shouldn't the host be given the option to accept a potential booking if I've messaged them to clarify that it's ok on their end to book again + with 3 guests? I had tried to reserve another flat earlier in the week however nobody responded to my request but this was completely overlooked by their software.Support then clarified that ""weekend last minute bookings"" constitutes a party even though I tried to book flats earlier in the week but nobody got back to me and my booking were cancelled. it's a 3 bedroom flat to house 3 people? Do not think this is very fair on the hosts completely unaware people are trying to book their apartments. The AI should inform the host, not make the decision for them.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

The Landlord, was an absolute nightmare, & actually threatened me, by insisting I move out, because he didn,t like what I was saying about his apartment! The bed was horribly uncomfortable, I could feel the mattress springs pressing against my back! I spoke to about 15 people @ Airbnb about the problem, & each time I spoke to a different person, & had to go over the whole story over & over again !They also wanted proof about what I was saying! The landlord was trying to damage control by saying there were no fleas! why then was my body covered in bites, & did I have to see a pharmacist to get hydrocortisone cream, & antihistamine tablets?The whole stay, was a complete nightmare!The Landlord @ one point threatened to come to the apartment, & evict me despite still having a contract with me that he refused to cancel!2 days after I left, the apartment was being advrtised again on Airbnb!?!! What are the consequences for his threatening behaviiour? I was travelling alone, so single female traveller 68 years old, being threatened by an Airbnb Landlord. I felt very unsafe!

1086,Customer Service Stinks,I have been on the phone all day with Airbnb customer service. I could not find my reservation and every time I tried logging in the site said my account was not verified or my cell phone number was linked to another account. So I called customer service and the girl could not speak English very well. So after 35 minutes I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. She told me it was against company policy to transfer me since I was not verified!! I said that’s why I’m calling but I cannot understand you and you obviously cannot understand me since you keep asking me the same questions. I’ve given up with this company.

1087,Beware before booking with Airbnb.,"Beware before booking with Airbnb.After not using them for 2 years, I booked a night in Austin last night. I booked an airstream camper. First it said it was in Austin. It was not. It was 25 miles from Austin. Second there were I think 5 campers and the photo in the listing was nothing like my camper. The door was wide open when I arrived almost 3 hours after check in. When I went inside it smelled like urine and what I guess were suppused to be beds were unmade stacks of foam. It was gross. Chickens running around, we're in Texas out in the country and you leave the door wide open? Long story short airbnb resolves it and refunds me. Then they encourage me to try again and give me a $50 coupon. Great!Ok. So I try again tonite.  Things got strange pretty quickly. The host sent me a questionnaire asking me if I had partys, would sign an agreement not to have party's and my reason for being in Austin. Yes. They sent this THREE times. After the third time I told them perhaps we should just cancel cause i've answered you 3 times and you seem uncomfortable. Then they say there is a $300 deposit or $35 waiver fee. Why wasn't this charge or offered when Ipaid for my booking??? The after 4 hours of waiting they say they can't confirm until I pay the waiver fee. THEN SEND ME TO ANOTHER SITE OFF OF AIRBNB TO COLLECT MONEY AND ASKED FOR MY ID. ID THAT HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY AIRBNB.I calle airbnb to cancel at 1pm today to tell them how upset I was consideing what happened last night. First, she told me never to put personal information on an outside site. She said someone was on it and would get back to me. I wait until 5pm and no call. Meanwhile the host calls. Again I sent the host a message through airbnb that Iwas cancelling. have had 4 calls with airbnb today and the host. The last rep just told me that it is now Airbnb policy to allow the host to collect money from you after you have paid to book, on another site. This person asked me for my drivers license on another site. NOT COOL. Head uo folks, this is not good. I'm sure Iost the money but glad I didn't give my information to these people. It sure feels like a scam and I told airbnb just that. They say no scam. This is exactly what happend to me during that Amazon anydesk scam. Now I understand all the bad review for Airbnb.

They are completely unresponsive, ignoring my case for over a month while refusing to address my legitimate refund request. However, when it comes to falsely charging guests for damages without any solid proof, they act instantly.They were trying to wrongfully charge me $350 for so-called “damages” with zero real evidence—just close-up photos that don’t even prove where or when the issue happened. Airbnb didn’t provide any valid invoices or repair receipts, yet they still sided with the host, showing a complete lack of fairness.Meanwhile, my valid refund claim for a broken bathtub and a missing workspace—both clearly misrepresented in the listing—has been completely ignored for over a month. I’ve contacted Airbnb multiple times, and all I get are empty promises that someone will “reach out soon.” No one ever does. They simply close my support tickets without resolving anything.Airbnb has proven to be a dishonest platform that prioritizes hosts over guests, even when the hosts are clearly in the wrong.

1095,"Avoid Airbnb – Unreliable, Costly, and a Complete Disaster","I used Airbnb six times in the last two months, and on three separate occasions, I was left stranded because the host either didn’t respond or failed to provide access to the property. This resulted in enormous last-minute costs for me, completely defeating the purpose of using Airbnb in the first place.The worst experience was on New Year’s Eve in Paris. I arrived at my Airbnb and attempted to contact the host numerous times, receiving no response. I was left standing outside in -4°C for hours, desperately trying to find alternative accommodation. Given that it was one of the busiest nights of the year, every hotel was either fully booked or outrageously expensive. It wasn’t until nearly 1 AM—five hours later—that I finally found a single room available, which cost me €300 more than my original Airbnb booking. The next day, the host finally responded, casually explaining that she had moved apartments and no longer lived at the address. How was this listing still active? How is Airbnb not verifying that their hosts still own or have access to the properties they advertise? They charge enormous fees—what exactly are they for if not basic verification?The second and third failures happened within 24 hours of each other.On one occasion, I arrived at the Airbnb at the designated check-in time, called and messaged the host repeatedly, and received no response for hours. I was forced to book a last-minute hotel late at night. Later, I found out the host had been sick and “fell asleep.” While frustrating, at least it was an explanation.However, the next night was even worse. I had booked a hotel through Airbnb, which had a 24-hour reception, so I assumed nothing could possibly go wrong. How wrong I was. After traveling across the city in a taxi, I arrived at the hotel to find a tiny sign on the door stating: “Closed for one month for renovations.” I had made the booking almost exactly one month prior—meaning Airbnb had allowed me to pay in full for a completely shut-down hotel. How does that even happen?Each time, Airbnb refunded what I had originally paid, but that did nothing to cover the hundreds of euros in additional costs I incurred. I booked through Airbnb to try and save money, but in the end, it cost me far more than if I had just booked hotels directly.I will be uninstalling Airbnb and never using it again. My advice?

What happened was that their vendor (apartment owner) had cancelled at the last moment (late in the evening), and it was too late to book another unit. So we contacted Airbnb and gave their staff an opportunity to find a replacement property. This was not done (due to late hour); and instead we were expressly told by Airbnb representative to go to a hotel. It was clearly discussed that it’s a more expensive option because we needed at least three rooms. This was clearly understood -- and we proceeded to do as instructed.Subsequently, very surprisingly, Airbnb refused to reimburse the costs that we had to endure associated with the three hotel rooms (in excess of the original budget, per the cost of the apartment I had contracted from Airbnb). I became aware that Airbnb collected $50 as penalty from the reneging owner/vendor. Strangely, however, Airbnb didn't even offer that amount towards my unplanned costs that night (caused by the breach/cancellation). Needless to say, this is dishonest/unacceptable, so we’ll not work with Airbnb in the future. Fortunately, alternatives do exist.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

She complained about WiFi and a few other things during her stay, not without justification.  So I was surprised a few weeks later when she booked another long-ish stay, and warned her that the Wi-Fi would still be problematic.To cut a long and painful story short, she's effectively now squatting in my AirBnb (the long stays should have been a warning - why not an AST?), and AirBnb are precisely zero help.  They spent 5 days trying to contact her and she simply ignored them.  They say I've no right to make her leave even though there's safety issues (the wood-burning stove chimney is overdue its annual sweep).  She won't allow access to anyone, and keeps a key in the door to stop it being opened.So to court I go.

When we brought this up with the host, his response was beyond unacceptable: he threatened to kick us out within two hours, at midnight, if we wanted a refund.In desperation, we reached out to Airbnb over 15 times, through messages and calls. Every single time, they promised to get back to us. Not once did they follow up. We made it crystal clear that we were afraid of ending up on the street in the middle of the night, yet Airbnb completely ignored us.And now, more than 24 hours later, we are still waiting for a solution. No help, no response, nothing. Airbnb’s customer service is an absolute joke—they do not care about their customers’ safety or well-being.This has been an absolute disgrace—both the host and Airbnb have shown zero responsibility or basic human decency.

They insist on calling, every email is just a reference to a chat you have to log into, there is never any information provided out with their own system. There is actually terms in their emails warning not to divulge the information! They must believe they are above the law, maybe they are in some locations but not the UK!AirBNBs host listed a room, I booked the room, then realised they had a better room so cancelled the first and rebooked the 2nd immediately.Turns out neither room was actually available and the host offered a 3rd room at an inferior spec and wouldn’t cancel the original.AirBNB would only refund to credit, meaning I would need to use their service instead of an actual refund fully supported by UK law and VISA chargeback!This credit according to AirBNB cannot then be sent to my bank as they do not have that capability. Think about that for a second, they can use those funds to pay another unrelated host and their own commission but not give back to the original payee? And they expect people to believe this!After 3 days of getting absolutely nowhere with AirBNB I filed a PayPal dispute, they refused to answer that as well, informing me I should only contact them! the arrogance was unbelievable. This went on for 3 days, air BNB saying only contact them whilst making it impossible to do that by closing the chats I had been using (luckily I had been screen recording so had proof).Then when I informed them I have no intention of conversing direct as I need PayPal to record this they closed my account literally 2 minutes later, it was more like 90 seconds and gave me no way to retrieve my funds that were with AirBNB as AirBNB creditPeople imagine large corporations don’t/aren’t allowed to lie, airBNB are behaving illegally. OK, I used Paypal and to be fair PayPal investigated and refunded me (1 month later). If I had just paid direct using VISA then a VISA chargeback would have been successful as well. Any other payment method? Good luck? This activity was absolutely 100% illegal. Unarguable. They locked me out of my own money and closed my account. No contact details no login details, absolutely nothing other than chargeback.After I escalated with PayPal from dispute to claim I actually imagined that AirBNB knew they were wrong and would just accept it (since they would not respond to the dispute), they didn’t, they took my funds kept them with AirBNB as AirBNB credit, locked me out of that account so no access to those funds, didn’t respond to me or the PayPal dispute but then had the nerve to contest the PayPal claim!

We reached out to customer support, but they simply sided with the hosts, ignoring our explanation. It feels like guest protection on Airbnb is practically nonexistent — any host can make baseless claims, and you’re left with either paying or having your reputation harmed. Additionally, finding accommodation suitable for a family with a young child and a school-age kid is already difficult — the filters don’t work well, and the actual conditions often don’t match the description.

To do Airbnb the host must apply for a hotel licence. Over the past few years Airbnb in our building has increased and causing misery and distress to the residents. We have formed a residents committee and are involving the police.Airbnb publicise an information sheet on Thailand which is wholly inadequate as it does not spell out that it is illegal here. What more is there to say? Guests should not book in Thailand, Airbnb are being irresponsible and putting profits before local laws. Let me repeat: Airbnb is illegal. Hosts of a condo unit cannot get a hotel licence as a condo is not a hotel.This is our home and every day the residents have to do battle with Airbnb guests. What do Airbnb do? Nothing as they are happy making the profits. Why does Airbnb not check the Thai laws and ban the platform in Thailand unless a host (such as a hotelier) can produce their hotel licence. I doubt they will reply or it will be a template response: ""we will consider all your points seriously as we are aware of our online worldwide responsibilities "" which is double speak for "" get lost loser, we have money to make.""Please Airbnb do the right thing here adopt a different paradigm for Thailand before something seriously goes wrong as we are at breaking point.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Unpopular titans don't tend to last unless they learn, change, understand and appreciate their business beyond simply profit margins. This is something hosts understand very well.

The host dismissed the issue, refused to take responsibility, and did nothing to ensure safety for future guests.I reached out to Airbnb for support, but the process has been nothing short of a nightmare. My claim was passed between “specialized teams” more than a dozen times, with over 100 messages and several phone calls. Despite assurances that I would be reimbursed, my claim disappeared from their system, and I have yet to receive a resolution months later. It is 5 months later and Airbnb still failed to respond to my case whatsoever!This lack of accountability and poor customer service is unacceptable.

1241,Airbnb cancelled my booking after taking payment twice,"I booked a cottage in the Cotswolds for a couple of night in May, booking process was so complicated having to supply driving licence, photo and prove ID etc.  I paid in full and was told I would get confirmation email.  I went to bed at 10.30pm, at 11.15 I was sent an email asking me to confirm my ID again but didn’t see it due to sleeping.  At 3.15am I received an email cancelling the booking due to not proving ID and a further email informing me that I would receive a refund.  The following morning I signed in to their app which asked me to confirm my ID, again, where they confirmed they accepted me to make a booking but then took another payment in full for the cancelled booking.  After many emails and phone calls they finally accepted that they had taken a payment twice after I sent them a copy of the transactions on my bank account but informed me it could take up to 15 business days for the refund.  I finally got the refund after a week!!!! If you are running a business that covers many countries you have to adapt the that country’s times not give deadlines for 3.15am to be answered by.

1254,Horrible Experience – Safety Concerns Ignored and Poor Customer Support,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user for over 8 years, but this last trip was the final straw that led me to close my account. My family’s vacation turned into a stressful ordeal, primarily because the host’s property was far from child-safe.•	Unsafe Furniture: None of the furniture was secured to the walls. When my 1-year-old tried to open a drawer, the whole piece nearly toppled over and actually fell on her once. We had to keep constant watch to prevent any further accidents.•	Injury from Pool Card: To make matters worse, a metal clip attached to the swimming pool access card ended up striking my 1-year-old’s eye, leaving it bruised. We were extremely concerned about potential vision damage.•	Host’s False Damage Claims: The host accused us of damaging the apartment and demanded money, yet never provided any proof. I refused to pay and raised these serious safety concerns with Airbnb.•	Airbnb’s Lack of Support: Despite my clear evidence of safety issues, Airbnb took the host’s side, showed no real concern for our family’s well-being, and ultimately did nothing to address the situation. The host even posted a negative review on my profile, and Airbnb refused to remove it—demonstrating they care more about profits than about prioritizing guests’ safety and peace of mind.Given these experiences, I can’t, in good conscience, continue using Airbnb. Our family’s safety should be paramount, but it became evident that was not Airbnb’s priority. I’ve chosen to delete my profile and will never book through Airbnb again.

1263,Beware: Hosts can claim you damaged something that you did not and Airbnb sides with them.,"Beware: Hosts can claim you damaged something that you did not and Airbnb sides with them.My wife and I have used Airbnb for over 10 years in at least 6 different countries and never had a problem with hosts claiming damage against us. That changed with our latest stay. A wooden chair at the rental had its leg snapped off clean, but when we got there the chair was propped up on the broken leg to look as if it was undamaged (which is dangerous!). My wife sat on the chair and of course the leg didn't hold. My wife messaged the host and sent a picture of the chair and leg within an hour of our arrival at the unit so we'd have documentation that it was already broken. The host seemed understanding so we set the chair aside for the rest of the stay and didn't think much more of it.Fast forward to the end of the stay a week later and the host says they're leaving us a 5 star review, and does. We leave them a 4 star review and then, after our review, the hosts claim with Airbnb that we broke the chair and asked for $1400 to replace it. We of course disputed it citing how the chair was found broken within an hour of our arrival but Airbnb sided with the host for some reason. We went through all appeals and Airbnb still sided with the host! We were so upset. We kept calling and disputing and asking to speak with someone, but they kept saying they would have to call us back. One time we couldn't answer the phone and later they said they closed our ticket because we didn't answer the phone. My wife and I both work full time with 3 small children (one baby).

1269,Airbnb’s Neglect for Customer Service and Host Accountability,"I feel compelled to share my recent disappointing experience with Airbnb, a platform I once trusted for its fairness, principles, and customer service. During an incredibly difficult time in my life—caring for my father at MD Anderson—Airbnb not only failed to support me but exacerbated an already stressful situation.Here’s what happened:I stayed at a property that was less than satisfactory, with issues ranging from a persistent odor to non-working internet and TV apps, and an uncomfortable bed that forced me to sleep on the couch. Despite this, I remained polite and accommodating. I mistakenly believed I booked for two nights but rushed out early the next morning due to an urgent phone call I received, unintentionally leaving behind my blanket and pillow.I contacted the host, Raul, through the Airbnb app, and we were in communication trying to arrange a time to meet so I could retrieve my belongings while I was still in town. I even offered to accommodate his schedule. However, he eventually began ignoring my messages and later falsely claimed that I had provided the wrong contact number, despite the fact that we had been communicating through the Airbnb app. I verified with Airbnb that my contact number was correct. Despite his negligence in communication, he refused to meet or return my property unless I provided a prepaid shipping label.When I turned to Airbnb for help, I was shocked by the lack of empathy and the procedural runaround I received. Despite my documentation proving the host ignored me and even read my messages in the app, Airbnb sided with the host, hiding behind policies and expecting me to pay to retrieve my belongings. Adding insult to injury, Airbnb closed my case while I was sleeping, giving me less than six hours to respond.This experience raised several disturbing questions:Where is Airbnb’s commitment to fairness and accountability?What is the purpose of customer service if it chooses not to serve?Why does Airbnb support hosts who act dishonorably and fail to meet basic professional standards?This isn’t just about a blanket—it’s about principles. I went out of my way to communicate and accommodate, yet both the host and Airbnb failed me at every turn. The policies Airbnb clings to seem designed to protect hosts while leaving guests helpless, even when the evidence clearly supports the guest’s case.To Airbnb: your handling of this situation was not just unprofessional; it was unconscionable. Your lack of compassion and refusal to address clear negligence is a betrayal of the trust guests place in your platform.To everyone reading this: if you value fairness, customer service, and accountability, I urge you to think twice before trusting Airbnb with your travel needs. My experience shows that when things go wrong, you may find yourself unheard, unsupported, and stuck with the consequences of others’ negligence.This is not just my story—it’s a warning. I will continue sharing my experience to ensure others are aware of how Airbnb handles situations like this. Fairness and decency should never be optional.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
1270,My Worst Experience on Airbnb,"My Worst Experience on AirbnbUnfortunately, this has been the worst place I’ve ever rented through Airbnb, and what makes it even worse is that Airbnb enabled this situation by allowing the host to rob me despite my status as a frequent user of the platform.The host, Lacy, proved to be an unprofessional, aggressive, and rude person. She seemed unable to handle constructive criticism and reacted inappropriately to my observations about the condition of the property.From the start, Lacy insisted incessantly on showing me the place in person and at night, even after I explained that I had just completed an exhausting 20-hour drive. According to her, it was essential to be present to hand over the keys, stating: “I NEED TO BE THERE TO SHOW IT TO YOU.” This situation felt extreme and invasive, as I’ve never been forced to meet a host face-to-face in all my years of using Airbnb. After receiving seven persistent messages, I had no choice but to comply, as she made it clear I would not be allowed to access the property without her supervision.The next morning, I woke up to discover the property’s true condition:•	The entire place was filthy and covered in mold.•	There were no smoke detectors.•	The kitchen utensils were rusty and moldy, which I documented with photos.•	The furniture was also covered in mold, causing an allergic reaction in my daughter.•	Basic appliances like a TV or microwave were missing.•	The floors were damp, creating a hazard for anyone walking on them.•	The staircase handrail was loose and unsafe.•	The door handles were so old they fell off, and some doors wouldn’t even close properly.•	The house was infested with spiders, and I found dead flies on the floor.In addition to the property’s appalling condition, Lacy has proven herself to be a pathological liar. She claims that the house is “historic,” which is false, and I have evidence to prove it. She also insists that she has rented this property before, yet this is a blatant lie. My review is the first on this property, and when I found it listed, the house was marked as new on the platform, something I can also prove.After spending just one night in this place, I filed a complaint with Airbnb, hoping they would address this unacceptable situation. Instead, I was met with disappointment. Airbnb not only allowed Lacy to manipulate the situation but also permitted her to charge me for three nights, even though I could only endure one in this old, unsafe, and neglected house.Lacy even went as far as to clean part of the visible mold in a kitchen cabinet and used a knife to poke small holes in the wood to claim, both to me and Airbnb, that it wasn’t mold but structural damage. My photos clearly show it was mold before her interference, and I have documented proof of her actions. On top of that, she sent me threatening messages, implying that I would not “destroy her business.” Airbnb failed to act on this evidence or take my concerns seriously.As a frequent user of Airbnb, I am deeply disappointed and disheartened by their lack of accountability in this matter. They allowed this host to manipulate the situation, lie, and essentially rob me, failing to protect their loyal users.For all these reasons, I strongly advise everyone to avoid this platform unethically and unprofessionally. Unfortunately, Airbnb’s failure to address this situation only made it worse.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1284,"It started off good, but then...","My family and I have traveled a lot together, and for a good while, Airbnb was our go-to resource for short-term rentals. We were considerate guests and always received good reviews from our hosts after each stay. Unfortunately, we had to learn the hard way how poorly Airbnb treats their customers in the event of a negative experience with an unscrupulous host. The rental in question had numerous issues with cleanliness, humidity, and the functionality of resources like water heating. Mildew was growing on the walls of one of the bedrooms. We didn't make any unreasonable demands of the host - we simply requested that he fix all that was supposed to have been functioning normally, given what was promised in the listing. At first he cooperated, albeit with a begrudging and arrogant tone, but he soon escalated his rudeness and in so many words informed us that we were complaining too much and would no longer receive any help from him.We were set to stay an additional month, but given the wide variety of issues that remained unresolved and the host's refusal to assist, we wanted to see if we could cancel without being charged. I contacted Airbnb support and their representative assured me that we would not face any penalties for a cancelation, nor would we be charged for the upcoming month. The representative was very clear on this point and the conversation was all in writing, so I felt confident enough to go forward with the cancelation. With assurances as clear and straightforward as this one, you can imagine my surprise when I saw a pending charge for the upcoming month. Once again, I contacted Airbnb, and I was informed by a different representative that they were going to charge me in full for the upcoming month in spite of what the previous representative had said. I showed them the records of the conversation, informed them that I would not have canceled unless I had received the go-ahead from the previous representative, but none of that was able to sway them in their determination to side with this ridiculous host and rip us off, even despite our spotless record of reviews and the fact that they knew they would be losing us as customers.In the time since that experience, I've done more research into similar debacles people have faced with greedy Airbnb hosts and the so-called support service that provides protection for their unethical behavior. It seems that the primary focus of this short-term rental monopoly is the quick cash grab and the maintenance of their stranglehold on the market. Privacy, honoring promises made by representatives, and overall customer welfare scarcely even make their list of priorities.

1286,Kafka-esque,"This is a review of the customer service to property managers rather than the app.They announced they were going to remove my advert with a 4.5 rating because of unspecified issues which may have been related to a customer complaint. They then say I can appeal if I can give evidence related to the removal. Since they haven't said why the advert is being removed it is difficult to prove why it is wrong. The have offered me the opportunity to correct whatever gave offense, but they refuse to tell me what it is, if anything, that caused offense, implying that as the homeowner, I should know.This approach is of course the same as the witch-burning trials of the 17th Century, where only by admitting guilt to an unknown accusation can you even begin to show contrition. It is also the plot of Kafka's ""The Trial"" about Stalin's system of justice.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
1287,Extremely Disappointing Customer Service and Misrepresentation,"I have been a long-time Airbnb user, and until recently, my experiences were generally positive. However, my latest booking has completely changed my perception of the platform.I booked a long-term stay at a property in Spain, expecting the listing to match the description. Unfortunately, this was far from the case. The property was grossly misrepresented in the following ways:Location Misrepresentation: The listing claimed the property was 15 km from Seville, but it is at least 18 km. This added significant travel time, doubling the public transport duration to over an hour and ten minutes.False Features: There was no terrace or courtyard view as described—just a small balcony overlooking a white wall. The kitchen was described as ""fully equipped,"" but the cookware was damaged, crockery was chipped, and the kitchen walls had visible damp with water dripping down.Health Hazards: Damp and mold were present from day one, causing sinus infections and allergies. The bathroom ceiling was also peeling.Unsafe and Noisy Area: Contrary to the description of a quiet and safe neighborhood, the area was noisy with hourly church bells and felt unsafe due to poorly lit streets and garbage.When I reported these issues to the host, they were dismissive and unhelpful. I then contacted Airbnb Support, expecting resolution. However, I discovered that Airbnb has no formal complaint process. Refunds are entirely dependent on the host's discretion, even when there is clear evidence of misrepresentation.This experience has been incredibly frustrating. Airbnb’s customer service is slow and ineffective, leaving guests like me to deal with uncooperative hosts and unsuitable properties. I feel Airbnb prioritizes its hosts over the well-being of its guests, which undermines trust in the platform.I hope Airbnb takes this feedback seriously and implements a clear, impartial resolution process for guests. As of now, I would not recommend Airbnb to others, particularly for long-term stays, given their lack of accountability and consumer protection.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I see that lady has over 1000 property on her account,  so basically what she does, she advertising properties at higher price then booking. com and then when guest books with her she makes booking on her name through booking. com or agoda, for me ots a scam as people overpaying and I am as resort owner have problems with reviews because if I am 3* and cheap my price is for the value I provide, but if people pay a lot and expect a lot that's a disappointment.  Also this lady Patinee left lowest reviews on my place when she never stayed at my place and the couple who stayed where very happy but review from their stay left not them but the lady who booked for them. And I am sure it's because I found that fraud and told her why you using my property to make money? She took off her account my property obviously now, but what is my point, there's probably a lot of people like her who duplicate advertisements with higher price and scamming people,  they don't have any taxes to pay, or wages...or cover the cost of maintenance the property  like property owners,  it's not good to make money this way. AIRBNB should take care more seriously on advertising , you should ask every property owner to provide documents and proof that you are the owner straight from beginning advertising on airbnb.  And in general to respect more property owners because we are opening our doors to strangers, letting them into our property, we trusting and we should get good income but not the middle person who gets very easy money not owning a single property.  Can you please check always the host, how many properties they have and it will be clear who scamer as when it has over a 1000 properties its obviously something not right.

1295,Unacceptable advertising,"I had a stay of 10 days through Christmas until December 29. The property listed #99 Vegas Pool and Spa. Although listed at a higher end price over $1,000 a night, and amenities and pictures for our needs during this holiday period, I booked it. Upon booking I asked for a courtesy walk through to insure price matched advertisement. I was denied! Upon check in, the house had a security issue. I don’t go into all the minute details but the house was accessible from single car garage. House was not cleaned in many areas. Again I won’t go into details because of numerous items. Notified host as well as Airbnb support. I was never contacted by host. Airbnb said someone would check it out. No one came. Second day we had a water leak from upped floor bathroom, coming through floor to laundry room. Contacted host and Airbnb. No response from host. Airbnb said someone would come. 3rd day someone came and said toilet was leaking. He would return yo fix. Later that day another water leak from shower. Contacted Airbnb and host. Nothing from host. Airbnb sent plumber. He said he could only make temporary repairs. Left and didn’t see anyone else return. Water is now leaking in laundry room and living room. I started a further inspection of property and found several listed amenities were not available or not working. Contacted host and Airbnb. No host response. A this point I started documenting everything I could find that was in disrepair and forwarded a detail list to host and Airbnb. Now 6 days into stay and Airbnb said they couldn’t refund but might try to find something else to move to. I have 16 people in my party with children celebrating Christmas. Where am supposed to go now??? I asked just as well as Airbnb for a five night refund for inconvenience, false advertisement and repairs that caused me to wait and readjust my activities with my family. Long story short, host was not communicating, Airbnb felt they couldn’t make any major decisions about refunding me. I contacted the BBB as well as the code enforcement office for the city of the listed property. Airbnb has been uncooperative in and host never made contact with me.

Being in the UK everything was being returned when I was asleep. Asked for a manager to call me during acceptable UK hours and was ignored. I asked again to speak to a manager and eventually spoke with someone that kept banging on about policy and how the most refund I could be given was 30% which was completely unacceptable given the atrocious condition of the apartment in which we stayed. Had to fight to get 50% and was made to feel like they were doing me a favour. Accepted this as did not have the energy to keep being ignored, to not be taken seriously and to keep fighting.Watch out - there are obviously some very very good and honest hosts but there are some who just want to make money out of their properties but are not prepared to spend money on the upkeep or repairs needed to keep standards for guests high. And it looks like Airbnb don’t really want to do anything after the event, as first time bookers we didn’t know we should have raised these issues at the time to be moved somewhere else.

This discourages renters from leaving true reviews which skews everything on Airbnb.  Don't be fooled this has turned into something that works well for the hosts, but gives renters a lot worse properties than they think they are going to get, and basically keeps renters from getting properties if they leave honest reviews that are negative.  We are currently at an airbnb property now where there are several negatives that would have kept us from renting, but now I am afraid of documenting these in my review due to not being able to have hosts approve me for future visits.  I am going to use VRBO more in the future or booking.com, because airbnb is poorly run and thrives on doing things like this that shaft the renter.I believe there are hosts that do not even own properties now on airbnb and are trying to broker units that are timeshares that are vacant, so they tell you they have a unit with a range of dates, when they really only have a few weeks available for the whole range, so they are constantly rejecting my requests for the week we needed for vacation, which creates a huge hassle for renters, who are waiting for approvals in good faith and waste time getting rejected over and over again, because the host is selfishly trying to fill one or two weeks for a vacation property they do not even own.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Nowadays many of the owners add a high cleaning fee on top of the rent, but still require renters should keep the house clean, ridiculously!Even worse, Airbnb doesn't seem to take complaints seriously. I had an issue with a property that was falsely advertised, but despite my detailed evidence, Airbnb refused to investigate or take meaningful action.

With the  weight of the downpour threatening to open the ceiling I decided to stay somewhere else while they were working to make the repairs. So I opened the  Airbnb app on my mobile device and braced myself for the high prices and low availability that New Years Eve usually causes.  I found a vacancy at the Carlisle apartments and requested reservation. Within three, maybe four minutes I received an answer from the Host, who identified herself as Leah. I couldn’t believe that it was open, nor could I believe the price. I thought there HAD to have been a 2 night minimum stay, but there wasn’t any. I confirmed and, once again Keah responded with the address, access code and, something that almost every front desk hotel agent forgets during checking; the WIFI credentials.The apartment was immaculately cleaned and meticulously appointed. We settled in and had a wonderful evening. I even cooked dinner. The night seemed to vanish and at nine the next morning I received a call from the roofing contractor informing me that the work would be finished at 11;00 AM. We hurriedly dressed, washed dishes and left. I found out later that we left in such a hurry that I forgot to leave Leah a note that I had used all of the dish detergent for evening and morning meals. She was most gracious and kind. During my matriculation to Dayton I stayed at 5-6 Airbnb properties and interacted with the respective hosts, each being a consummate professional. Yet, Leah stands head and shoulders above them all. I can even expand on that assessment. I’m a retired Certified Hospitality Sales Executive with 36 years of experience throughout the country. I’ve worked in Atlanta ,San Jose , San Francisco and in the RDU areas. I’ve trained several new sales managers and mentored many with experience. Leah’s customer centrism eclipses many of them. She makes it EASY to do business with her brand. Even when faux pas’ like the fish soap and the pot holder, my friend accidentally burned. Leah was a sincere pro! The AIRBNB organization brand is so fortunate to have an individual like Leah. Going forward, I’ll be recommending AIRBNB to my clients, visiting family members and others who are coming to Dayton on business strictly using Leah’s example as the benchmark for their expectations. I’m convince that if AIRBNB had the foresight to choose Leah, there must be other Hosts here that mirror her skill set and display, as she did, that know exactly what  the word !HOSPITALITY’ means:  A love for strangers’.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,5

The guest then stays longer in the condo than the check-out date of the cancellation, telling me it's in accordance with the agreement they made with AirBNB. Again, i'm confused and try to contact AirBNB, but they are not reachable and do not answer my support messages.While they cancelled the booking, they removed the booking entirely from my booking calendar, so i started getting bookings while having guests in the room.I had to reject these and ask them to book again later. Luckily they were okay with that, but then AirBNB added the booking back into my calendar, so someone obviously was reading my messages but just didn't want to reply me. The result being that they were not able to book, because now the calendar was blocked until the end of the original stay.For me, i had guests living for free in my condo because of AirBNB support making that agreement with them without my consent and i lost a booking.The support is completely neglecting their responsibility and just gives me automated responses and telling me that i can just ask the guest for money myself.But the guest is long gone and will not pay me anything.AirBNB was the broker on this deal and took it upon themselfe to give out my condo for free and make sure i lost other bookings in high season here.I lost more than 600 USD in rental income because of this and no matter how i look at it, i can only see AirBNB being responsible.Yet, when i contact them, explain my case, they will ignore it all and just give me some automated responses.I can not stress this enough.DO NOT USE AIRBNB as a host, they have no interest in you and in case of mistakes, they will not be taking any responsibility.We are moving out of Airbnb to other booking platforms from January and i urge other hosts to do the same.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Airbnb informed me that the host is making the decision to stand on the refund policy in the agreement but that policy didn't include any consideration for situations where safety is a concern. I was only given 268.00 of the 1270.00 that I paid for the reservation. Be careful, Airbnb doesn't care about your safety.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1330,"Do not, under any circumstances, become an Airbnb host!","I have been a host for Airbnb for about a year, very irregularly. As I live in another town, I have to travel a long way to set up my accommodation. Therefore, I do not accept last minute cancellations. Now, a sweaty bicycle traveler with probably ten different types of small plastic bags on her bike turned up in my flat. After a day of staying there (and apparently having done her laundry), this person wanted to cancel the rest of her reservation. She wrote: ""My friend is sick! I must help her..."" ( What a lousy lie). I received a question through the Airbnb system asking if I accept the cancellation. I clicked on ""decline"", but nevertheless I soon got a message that the booking was cancelled. When I protested to Airbnb, they told me the host had ""moderated"" my rule (???!?!!).In one day the person had managed to thoroughly mess up my apartment, left uneaten food in the fridge and washed probably ten loads of laundry (I judged by how much detergent had been used). Yet the person still managed to berate the standard of my apartment as a reprisal for not letting her cancel. The review no longer mentioned the ""sick friend"", but said the standard of the apartment was so low (for a cycling, sweaty traveller!) that she had to cancel the booking. All the other guests had given the apartment the highest possible score (5). Now, months later, Airbnb is still charging me more than 80 euros for this cancellation, which caused me so much headache. How many days have I spent on this matter and now this! That I am being made to pay (presumably the cyclist who cancelled the accommodation will also have to pay his share to Airbnb). And this is only one trouble with Airbnb I have had. They are so many, that I decided I will no longer continue hosting with Airbnb, as none of the rules I have created apply and everything is really complicated, vague and nothing can be trusted. I had also made a rule that I only wanted to accommodate people who had stayed there before (with reviews), but suddenly I started getting bookings from first-timers. Of course, Airbnb wants to get as much money as possible from both hosts and guests and they are constantly going to the limit of where the rights of the consumer are when the system is really unclear. I will boycott Airbnb for the rest of my life, and I certainly do not recommend booking or hosting to anyone. Now I see from these Trustpilot comments that there are already a lot of us.

1333,USE EXTREME CAUTION!!!!,"I am writing to share an extremely distressing experience with Airbnb's booking system. I am currently in Atlanta to be near my fiancé, who is in critical condition at Piedmont Hospital with a traumatic brain injury following a severe car accident. After purchasing a $500 Airbnb gift card from Walmart to secure accommodation near the hospital for myself, my son, and my sister, I encountered significant issues.Upon attempting to book a property, Airbnb's AI system incorrectly flagged my reservation, citing concerns about ""unauthorized parties"" and potential vandalism. These accusations are completely unfounded - I am a 55-year-old individual trying to stay close to my critically ill fiancé. When I attempted to book a different property, I received the same automated rejection.Airbnb then informed me that this decision could not be overturned and suggested I book a hotel or private room instead. This defeats the purpose of purchasing an Airbnb gift card, which I specifically bought to secure appropriate accommodation for my family during this medical crisis.My attempts to resolve this issue have been met with promises of return calls that never materialize. I now have $500 trapped in an Airbnb account that I cannot use, and more importantly, no suitable place to stay while supporting my fiancé during this critical time. This system failure has created unnecessary stress during an already challenging personal crisis.I request immediate attention to this matter and a full refund of my gift card balance. Airbnb's automated systems should not prevent legitimate guests from securing necessary accommodation, I'm especially in emergency situations like mine.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

They do not tell you that you need valid ID until after you have booked and paid.I've cancelled the booking, and apologised to the host. AirBnB have refunded both the gift card and the cash for the booking, but they have credited the gift card to my AirBnB account which, of course, is useless because I can never book anything because I don't have ID. So this feels like theft because I'm down £50 and they're in the money. This was a Christmas gift, which is now in their bank account.I was on the phone to their customer service, who suggested I renew my passport and then try to book something. They could have refunded me by issuing another gift card that we could use on my husband's account, but no.It's also very difficult to contact Customer Services through their message system without anyone thinking you have an emergency situation and calling the emergency services. If you happen to be in the middle of an emergency, I seriously doubt you're going to toggle all the way to the AirBnB message tray, for them to take forever to respond, anyway.*UPDATE*  Airbnb Customer Services have offered a solution to the problem. They have suggested that my husband open an account, verify his ID, and then buy another £50 gift card to credit to his account, so that we can then use that to make a booking.

1340,Not Too Shabby for First-Timers…,"It was our one and only experience with AirBnb thus far from a few months ago, and while we’ve staved off of utilizing them for years - there really wasn’t much of a choice in one of our trips recently due to the secluded destination we were traveling to as well as the high season for fall foliage. Most hotels were booked to the max and we had extremely limited options and decided to chance it with one of the properties offered on AirBnB. What I thoroughly enjoyed as a tough customer was the reviews provided per property in order to make a sound decision. Sure, I’m not going to take each and every review into consideration if they come off as unreasonable and/or silly but plenty of times low ratings are there for a reason, and especially when folks spend their hard-earned cash to have a good vacation and precious time with their loved ones. After much poring of reviews and accumulated time reviewing various properties, we finally settled on one and luckily it did not disappoint! The property was even better in person and the housecleaning was immaculate. We had no need for further assistance until after the trip, but other than that - for the two nights we’ve spent, we’ve had no complaints. We did leave a camping blanket behind by accident when we left the property and after much back and forth with the owner, we’ve soon realized it was a hassle to even get it shipped. We won’t rule out AirBnb in the future since we are dealing with individual folks but all in all, we can only rate it as neutral for the time being since it was our first experience. We’re not planning on making it into a habit because plenty of mishaps can go awry with vacation rentals like these and who has the time for that? Based on the endless reviews all across the Internet of negative experiences with AirBnb, we are still wary with choosing them whenever we travel.

1360,Aribnb unfair resolution processes with lack of transparency and accountability,"I had a disappointing experience with Airbnb's resolution process during a recent stay. The property had several unresolved maintenance issues, including a blocked sink and a malfunctioning shower. Despite this, the host later claimed damages for a laundry machine that failed during my stay. I firmly believe this malfunction was due to pre-existing conditions, not my actions.Throughout the dispute, I requested the following from Airbnb:Evidence of Responsibility: I asked for clear and specific proof that I caused the laundry machine malfunction. Airbnb referenced ""photos and documentation"" but did not provide any evidence directly linking me to the issue.Cost Breakdown: I requested an itemized breakdown of the £69.80 charge, including repair invoices or assessments. This was not provided.Consideration of Property Condition: I highlighted several unresolved issues at the property that indicated a lack of proper maintenance, which may have contributed to the malfunction. This broader context was not acknowledged in Airbnb's decision.Transparency in Decision-Making: I sought a detailed explanation of how the decision was reached, but the response relied primarily on the absence of prior complaints about the laundry machine, which does not constitute evidence.Unfortunately, these reasonable requests were not addressed, and the resolution process did not meet the standard of fairness or transparency I expected. Guests should not be held liable for issues stemming from poor property maintenance. I hope Airbnb improves its process to ensure future decisions are more balanced and evidence-based.Below is the only explanation I received from Airbnb:""After a thorough review of all the evidence and factors, we have checked with the previous reservations and found out that there were no reported issues about the laundry machine before and after the reservation. During your stay, the machine had been working during the 1st use as mentioned by you as well. Under these conditions whenever there is an internal error the machines will provide error codes which wasn’t the situation in your case. We request you to provide any evidence showing that the damage was not caused by you so that we can reconsider the claim.""This response lacks both evidence and accountability. It relies solely on the absence of prior complaints rather than addressing the broader issues or the host’s responsibility for maintaining the property. I expected a fairer and more transparent resolution process from Airbnb.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

The host that advertised on Airbnb (host operate as a rental company as well) had known about the issue but done nothing to resolve it.We were left to our own devices with no assistance from hostCalled Airbnb and no help given to rebook and no offer of compensation. We were left with a ruined Christmas holiday. Had to find new accommodation myself that was significantly more expensive. Airbnb after 2 days of dealing with them offered a fraction of my additional cost as a voucher to use with them for the future. I’m still about 1000$ out of pocket and they don’t care.They imposed a fine on the host for not honour the booking but was planning on keeping the money for themselves and let me have all the additional costs. Had to find a hotel the first night and Airbnb promised to repay me for it but now they are saying they will try to get approval to do so. Can’t trust the company at all.If you book with Airbnb on peak travel dates and popular destinations then if you encounter any problems you’re on your own.

1376,Hidden Camera in Our Bedroom—Airbnb Ignored It and Punished Us for Speaking Out,"I discovered a hidden, tampered lens in the bedroom shared by me and my girlfriend overlooking the bed we were sleeping in during our stay at an Airbnb property. Concerned for our safety and privacy, I immediately reported this to Airbnb and asked for their assistance. Their response was to send a message to the host, who then turned around and sent me aggressive, intimidating messages about me messaging Airbnb. That was the extent of Airbnb’s “support.”As if that weren’t bad enough, Airbnb allowed the host to leave a misleading, slanderous review accusing me of breaking house rules (the apparent rule he created to not contact Airbnb.....) instead of addressing the actual issue. Despite my attempts to have Airbnb acknowledge the gravity of the situation—particularly that women’s safety was put at risk—they have simply ignored the aggressive messages, done nothing to remove the bias slanderous review, and made it clear they do not plan to act.What’s worse is that the property is likely still available on Airbnb’s platform, and the hidden lens has probably just been moved or disguised further. This means other guests could also unknowingly have their safety and privacy violated.This experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. When a company can’t be trusted to handle genuine safety concerns, especially those involving potential violations of privacy, it’s a red flag for anyone who values their well-being and safety. Based on what happened to me and my girlfriend, along with similar experiences reported by others, I would strongly advise against using Airbnb.

I’ve been treated most poorly by the Airbnb team.A few months ago I booked a cabin by the lake in Virginia for my friends and family. All we wanted is to grill and use the hot tub, which we did and had a great time in the house. The house seemed fine to me, I don’t pay attention to tiny details as I am there to relax and not to do a full inspection.After we checked out, I left a 5 star review to the host, and then later the host gave me a 5 star review and mentioned we left the house in great condition. After that, reviews can’t be changed.A few hours later the host is writing to me saying we destroyed the house. He falsely accused me and my friends and family of vomiting all around the place (we did not and he didn’t provide any proof of that), destroying a fridge, breaking a mirror, clogging a dishwasher, etc etc etc. I had a belief that you only take pictures of the house if it’s really damaged, and since the house looked fine, I didn’t take any pictures. How wrong was I.The interesting part is that I looked up the Airbnb posting of the same house and also I found it on Zillow. The mirror that the host is claiming I broke - well, it was broken before. That same crack is in the pictures on the Airbnb posting and the host bought the house with that same crack in 2022. While I don’t have pictures of all the accusations that the host is putting on me, I believe this is a strong enough evidence that proves i am being taken advantage of.I also found a picture of the fridge - the fridge looks perfect and no dents there. I provided a receipt dated a day before the trip that includes disposable dishes to prove that we didn’t use the dishwasher (which we really didn't). The answer from the Airbnb team is outrageous - we are not taking this evidence because you didn’t take pictures. How on earth am I supposed to take pictures of a dishwasher to prove I didn’t clog it? Why is the picture of the bathroom that has the same crack on the mirror (even the same shape) not legit evidence and why would a picture that I made be more valuable? And finally, why the picture of the fridge that I have is not acceptable? It’s a picture, just like you asked.The customer service is just stalling me and making me wait, 2 weeks with no response, and the supposed date of the charge is coming up. I have said a dozen of times that I am not authorizing the charge until I see explanation why my evidence is inadmissible as well as asking the host to provide pictures ‘before’ the damages that he’s accusing me of.

After many attempts to make them aware of the horrid situation the orginal ""host "" put me in, they placed me on multiple long holds to check with their ""supervisor"".

1404,"If you complain about customer service, Airbnb blocks further bookings","Host - if you complain about customer service they alter the algorithm so you stop getting bookings. The most appealing customer service that is outsourced to people who cannot comprehend English and use generic scripting. As soon as you challenge their scripted answers, they close the case. It’s a scam to not allow a complaint to escalate. This is what a Senior Case Manager, Rhea, wrote back to me when I asked for a matter to be escalated beyond Senior Case Management level:- “By the way this is Rhea one of the Senior case manager here in AirbnbThat's the reason why I coordinated with you yesterday after I received the escalated case for me to further assist.I found your case with Shivam this case was created December 04, 2024 this case was close due to no response and no concern has been shared from you, here in Airbnb if the case has no progress or response from the Guest or Host we will set deadline for 24-48hours for you to share your concern and to response if not then we will close the case to cater other case.Please do note that since the case was assigned to me, you can't speak back to the previous senior case manager or ambassador that you want to speak with.Based on your conversation with Jeet the case has been close due to they tried to call you for the agreed time but unable to reached you and since the case was no concern has been shared Jeet close the case.I do respect your point of view on how you feel or find the customer service in UK as well as your stories and all the case was documented here on our end as well as the conversation for reference.Furthermore, I am hoping to have your response for me to further assist.I wanted to acknowledge that you've had a chance to read my previous message. Thank you for taking the time to do so. I genuinely appreciate your attention.I completely understand that you might have numerous other commitments and priorities at the moment. Your time is valuable, and I respect that. Please know that I don't want to cause any disruption or inconvenience.With that being said, I will go ahead and close this case, and you may contact us through this number 1-844-234-2500, I'm hoping that you can speak with Airbnb Public Relations in Dublin, Ireland ambassador for you to share your concern and for us to further assist you.Apologies Lyle that you feel we are messing around but believe me that's not our intention we are here to help.” -They say they give one 24-48 hours to respond however that is not true as they close the cases before you get a chance to respond. They message and call you in the European early hours of the morning such as 0200 as they are outsourced in Asia, and before you wake up to read a message, they have closed it.It’s blatantly clear that AI or ChatGPT is used to construct these conversationsSo as long as the money is pouring into their accounts from you hosting and opening your home to strangers, they will support you and you will receive a plenitude of bookings. However as soon as you call for assistance because their single guest has arrived at your home with 2 more unsolicited people who all try to share a bed, Airbnb Superhost and Security support, do not know what to do and they ignore you. As soon as you lodge a complaint about them, the bookings stop. I have evidence of this. I have been an Airbnb host for over 10 years and until the pandemic, the customer support was from the IS or Ireland and was superb. It’s since been outsourced elsewhere and the customer service is diabolical. It’s become too big and they don’t care about the host’s safety anymore.

1415,Airbnb hosts (& guests)…BEWARE,"I am writing this review to inform current and future Airbnb clients about how it penalises its 'valued' hosts. I have been a host for at least five years and earned the title'superhost'. I have been relatively satisfied with their level of service, and despite the increase in the percentage they retain from the total guest payout (almost 20% now) I have remained loyal to the company. This year, however, I have realised that the company's policies are driven by profitability to the detriment of the individual host (and guests).In May, through no fault of mine, the WiFi went down in my rental the evening before a guest was due. Having contacted my internet provider I was informed that the fault would require an engineer visit and could not be rectified for several days. My initial concern was for my guest, who needed this facility during their break. I informed the guest, who was extremely grateful for my care in the matter and requested a refund so they could find another lodging with WiFi. I explained that despite my 'strict cancellation policy' I would accept their cancellation and forego the payout. Airbnb phoned me immediately asking for verification of events, which I provided. They then informed me that I would be fined in excess of £180 and that my 'Superhost' title would be withdrawn. I was stunned! I was being penalised for considering a guest's needs and comfort before my own ! An Airbnb 'ambassador' explained that I had failed to provide one of the services that was in my listing, therefore the fault was mine!The obvious result of this aggressive treatment of their hosts (who, after all, they are wholly reliant on) is that issues will not be reported to guests. Clearly, this tactic works....who in their right mind would knowingly put themselves at risk of being fined almost £200? Ultimately the guest suffers. This is borne out by the number of poor reviews here.What a pity that there is no room in Airbnb's policies for compassion and understanding, or even simple humanity.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1
1416,Concerns Regarding Host Treatment and Platform Policies,"To Airbnb Team,I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the way I have been treated as a host on your platform. Recent experiences have raised critical issues that I believe need immediate attention and resolution.1. Targeted Actions and Unjust Surveillance:I have noticed a pattern where my account appears to be under excessive scrutiny. Reservations have been cancelled without prior notification to me or my guests, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Additionally, it feels as though my communications with guests are being excessively monitored, leading to further distrust.2. Listing Management Issues:On multiple occasions, my listings have been removed or suspended during the night, leaving me completely defenseless. This not only impacts my business but also affects the trust and convenience of my guests.3. Inconsistent Hosting Requirements:There is a lack of consistency in how I am expected to manage bookings. For instance, some days guests can book instantly and are provided with check-in instructions automatically, while on other days, I must manually handle every step. This inconsistency is highly disruptive and creates unnecessary workload, especially during peak hours.4. Unresolved Financial Discrepancies:Specific financial matters remain unresolved. For instance:I paid for guests reservations out of my pocket and have yet to receive reimbursement.These situations undermine my confidence in the fairness and transparency of Airbnb's processes.I have always strived to uphold the highest standards as a host and to ensure that my guests have a positive experience. However, the challenges I am facing due to the platform's actions and policies are making it increasingly difficult to continue hosting effectively.Very disappointing for you have yet to pay me a few thousand dollars.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

""Angela"", as this company calls themselves on airbnb, had only messaged me thirty minutes earlier asking if he could come into the apartment.I never saw this message until he was around ten feet away from me.He came in without knocking or announcing himself and told me he had express permission to come in whenever as authorized by Peacock Bungalows. For non-emergency repairs, this is completely illegal. As a single woman I was very concerned as I had no idea who this person was or why he was in my apartment and felt worried about my safety. He turned out to be friendly, but the fact that he was able to enter the apartment without any notice (not even knocking) is a huge concern for any woman's safety.When I told people at Peacock Bungalow what had happened as the handyman was still in the apartment, I asked them to please have someone knock before they come in for safety.They never responded to that question which tells you everything you need to know about them. More so, I luckily was able to leave the apartment early from airbnb due to what happened and, ""Angela"" accused me of just contacting Airbnb for a refund to get out of a cancellation fee.Her review of me was disgusting. I had absolutely real concern to have a grown man come into my room by myself, as many woman have had experiences where that dynamic could go awful extremely quickly.I was very upset to see this accusation from this company, but am more disappointed that airbnb viewed this review as just being their opinion when I had screenshots verifying that I had expressed my concerns to, ""Angela"" while the handyman was still in my apartment, even though they accused me of only bringing up concerns about consent later.Peacock Bungalows broke the law, putting my safety at risk while I paid a premium to stay at their apartment, and then slandered my intentions about wanting to leave summing it up to greed.

Worse, the host initially communicated with me outside the platform and offered private discounts, which violates Airbnb’s own policies.Airbnb needs to address these failures.

1445,Airbnb Has Lost Its Mission: A Personal Review,"When Airbnb launched over a decade ago, it was a revolutionary idea. A platform offering something different from the sterile, impersonal listings of traditional booking sites. Cozy homes, personalized experiences, and human connection—it was the antidote to cookie-cutter hotels.Back then, as a loyal supporter, I couldn't have imagined how far the platform could stray from its original values. But as companies grow, processes evolve, and bureaucracy takes over, it seems Airbnb has lost sight of the very essence that made it special: quality and trust.A Summer to Forget: My Airbnb ExperienceLast summer, my family and I rented a house in Montenegro for 30 days through Airbnb. Montenegro itself is stunning—a country full of charm, incredible food, and warm people. But our stay? It was ruined by Airbnb's failure to uphold its promises.Let me paint a picture of what we endured:- The ""Full Kitchen"" That Wasn’t:We arrived to find a ""full kitchen"" that lacked basic utensils. A pan? Nowhere to be found. We had to buy one just to cook. This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s misrepresentation.- The Leaking Washing Machine:With two kids, we needed a working washing machine. On the second day, it started leaking water all over the floor. The host, initially unresponsive, eventually sent a plumber, but the issue persisted. Every three days, we spent two hours wiping water off the floor during a washing cycle. Instead of enjoying our holiday, we became janitors.- Centipede Invasion:Giant centipedes (yes, the terrifying *Scolopendra galapagoensis*) found their way into the house at night. Sleep became impossible as we spent sleepless nights guarding the kids' room and scouring the house for these creatures. The host’s response? “That’s normal near the forest.” Normal?! After seeing one of the massive centipedes, even he admitted it was unusual. We had to buy poison ourselves, but the problem never fully went away.- A Misleading “Pet-Friendly” Label:We chose this listing partly because it was labeled as pet-friendly. Imagine our shock when the host threatened to shoot stray dogs that wandered onto the property. Pet-friendly? Hardly.The Final Insult: Airbnb's Resolution Center FailureAfter all this, the host demanded €120 for a ""damaged mattress."" The mattress was already damaged when we arrived, but that didn’t stop him. Airbnb’s Resolution Center? Useless. Their system, which is supposed to mediate disputes, completely ignored the issues we raised. Instead, they sided with the host, forcing us to waste countless hours answering redundant questions and fighting a one-sided battle.When I countered with a claim for €1,250 to cover our ruined experience, Airbnb responded with a robotic message: ""Our policies do not allow us to fulfill your request."" Policies? What about their responsibility to verify the host's claims or ensure guest safety?A Lost Vision for AirbnbThis isn’t just a complaint about a bad stay—it’s a wake-up call. Airbnb has buried its user-friendly ethos under layers of soulless protocols. Their policies prioritize bureaucracy over humanity, ignoring the safety and well-being of families like mine.This Airbnb review highlights how far the platform has strayed from its mission of trust and connection. If they can’t protect their users or enforce basic standards, what’s left of the platform's promise?To Airbnb, I extend my condolences for losing sight of your higher mission. Your users deserved better, and now, many of us are questioning why we ever trusted you in the first place.Keywords:Airbnb review, bad Airbnb experience, Airbnb complaints, Airbnb customer service, Airbnb host issues, bad vacation rental experience, Airbnb policies, Airbnb Resolution Center, Airbnb family safety.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

They promised us they would have the emergency department call us and they would send someone to open the door. We had to call back for several hours only to only be told the same thing. They kept using the excuse they were having a busy night. The Emergency department or any Airbnb department never contacted us and basically repeatedly said how they understood our frustration. They would actually never call us back and just sent a message the next day 15 hours later on how they were sorry they never responded. We also tried the help chat several times but they would not respond after we explained our issue. The only response they would give us again we understand your frustration. I worked over twenty years in customer service and this was the worst display of customer service I have been involved with. Me and my wife realized a few hours in there was going to be no help or call back to help us and our young children, they were lying to get us off the phone. Several hours later we personally contacted the host. I will tell anyone reading this the support is awful and no matter how Airbnb tries to spin it the ""ambassadors"" are useless and they hire cheap support who's main goal is to get you off the phone.

We had a nice stay who only wanted the best for us. We booked the room for 14 days, but when we got to the house on the third and last day, there had been a murder in the backyard and the whole house was cordoned off by the police. We were 9 people who were excluded from the house, including a young mother with two small children. We tried to get in touch with Airbnb, but they were only interested in how much of a refund they could get away with sending back. But we needed rehousing. Our host was there but she couldn't do much. We got no help in this chaotic situation. The house was closed for 48 hours. We were allowed to collect personal medicine, otherwise the house was completely closed. We finally booked a hotel room, which was not easy at 11pm, and expected Airbnb to refund this, but they have kept us to this extent, repeatedly closed our case, talked to employees who knew nothing and spoke almost incomprehensible English, they had to have our story over and over and finally ignored every message from us. They completely do not care about their customers/guests. So we also want to warn against using this irresponsible company. It is possible that it is a cheap form of accommodation, but if something out of the ordinary happens, there is no help from Airbnb.Jeg melder mig til koret om den elendige kundeservice Airbnb udviser.

Vi var 9 personer der var udelukket fra huset, heraf en ung mor med to små børn. Vi forsøgte at komme i kontakt med Airbnb, men de var kun interesseret i hvor stor en refusion de kunne slippe af med at sende retur. Men vi havde brug for genhusning. Vores husvært var der men hun kunne ikke gøre så meget. Vi fik ingen hjælp i denne kaotiske situation. Huset var lukket i 48 timer. Vi fik lov til at hente personlig medicin ellers var huset totalt lukket. Vi bookede tilsidst et hotelværelse, hvilket ikke var let kl 23, og forventede at Airbnb ville refundere dette, men de har i den grad holdt os hen, gentagende gange lukket vores sag, talte med medarbejdere der intet vidste og talte et næsten uforståeligt engelsk, de skulle have vores historie om og om igen og sidst ignoreret enhver besked fra os. De er fuldstændig ligeglade med deres kunder/gæster. Så vi vil også advare imod at bruge dette uansvarlige firma.

I have a relative who said she would go pick up the items for me and at first the owner said yes, then a couple of days later (they would not respond to text messages or phone calls) said no because it was a security risk and they could only mail them to me.

1545,No support if things go wrong,"Terrible experience with host communication and little help from Airbnb. We were travelling with our 3m baby and so had extra bags and stroller. I booked a place after confirming with the host there was an elevator however only when we actually arrived at the apartment building were we told the elevator doesn't work and the apartment is on the 6th floor. Passing residents told us this has been broken for months and that it won't be fixed for a few more weeks. So not wanting to lug the stroller and bags up and down 6 flights of stairs every time we come and go we had to cancel the booking. Contacted the Airbnb who said they would contact the host and then get back to me. Given it was late at night (9pm) you'd think they'd call back soon, especially with a crying baby in the background. I call them back 30m later and am told that they will help with a refund only and I need to do another booking. Now booking last minute hotel late at night ended up costing us more than double than if we'd booked the hotel in the first place and Airbnb never got back to me again. So I was left late at night with a cryinging baby and no place to stay, made to pay more than double for a hotel. I don't think I'll ever use Airbnb again as this was a very stressful evening with no help from Airbnb",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1551,TitleExtremely Disappointing Experience – Scammed Twice!,"Title: Extremely Disappointing Experience – Scammed Twice!I’ve had a truly dreadful experience with Airbnb while trying to book accommodation for the Valencia Marathon weekend (Nov 28 - Dec 2). This nightmare has been going on since July, and it’s left us in an incredibly stressful situation.First, we booked an apartment, only for the host to ask us to cancel due to “building works” and push for the cancellation to be made on our end. Luckily, Airbnb stepped in and forced them to cancel, which should’ve raised alarm bells about the host. But thinking it was an isolated issue, we booked another property—only to have the exact same scam happen again. This time, it turned out to be the first host’s mate running the same scheme, and again, they tried to get us to cancel.We’ve been completely messed around on one of the busiest weekends in Valencia, and now we’re left with nowhere to stay. All affordable options are gone, and we’ve been pushed way over our budget. The fact that Airbnb allows hosts like these to operate is shocking, and customer support has not been helpful enough in fixing the situation.Airbnb, this is a coordinated scam, and you should be doing far more to protect your customers. We expect you to find us suitable accommodation at the price we initially paid and block these fraudulent hosts immediately.

I’ve tried contacting their customer service department who have fobbed me off and tried to blame my credit card company, and basically said they won’t do a thing about it.So I can’t book any accommodation or use my credit card until I receive these funds back - and who knows when that will be?

The worst part is they do not even tell you that deductions will be made or give any communication to this affect so you are essentially financially harmed at a random future date.

As both a host and a guest, I have experienced firsthand how Airbnb unjustly takes money from hosts, fails to protect users, and consistently shifts blame onto others to avoid responsibility.As a host, I have had funds taken from my payouts without any reasonable explanation or valid reason. Airbnb's customer service was unhelpful and did not provide any meaningful resolution. It is clear that Airbnb prioritizes profit over the well-being of their hosts, showing a blatant disregard for their partners.Furthermore, as a guest, I have encountered numerous issues with accommodations that were not as advertised or were unsanitary. Despite reporting these issues to Airbnb, they consistently sided with the hosts and refused to take appropriate action to address the problems. This lack of accountability demonstrates Airbnb's failure to protect their users and uphold their responsibilities.Overall, my experiences with Airbnb have been disappointing and frustrating. It is evident that Airbnb is more concerned with maximizing profits than ensuring a safe and fair platform for both hosts and guests.

The apartment may be clean enough or have a classic style, but the amount of stuff one has to buy, including often laundry detergent, coffee pods, fresh milk and etc,  ends up costing more than going out.  I end up carrying a grocery bag with salt, olive oil, coffee, pods, laundry, pods, etc., with me, but I still spend more. In addition there’s almost always something wrong with the place; a long flight of stairs or three that were not mentioned in any of the reviews or the description, or a construction project that’s going on in the apartment upstairs. The apartment may overlook a busy bus stop, or bar where people talk and laugh until four in the morning every night, or there may be a trash pick up right outside your bedroom window.Lastly, one is often staying out of the center of town; This can be great in terms of getting a sense of parts of a city that aren’t touristy, But if you’re only staying for a few days, it doesn’t make sense to learn the whole metro system.I also feel like it’s having an impact on housing costs in some of the places that I’ve visited.

I provided multiple pictures and videos of this place and they said there was not enough evidence and lied about not seeing the photos sent in the digital chat where I then had to provide screenshots of our conversation.

I booked a home in Hollywood Florida by Andrew and Maria (I believe they live in NYC). When I arrived the house looked abandoned and nothing like the photos. Standing at the door there was a bad smell, we enter the home and they smell was like something out of a nightmare! You can compare it to a urine/sewer/moldy smell. It was dirty like the place hasn't been used in a very long time. The couches had dirt and red stains on them. It was inhabitable. My mum got a headache upon arrival so we quickly exited the house. And contacted the owners as we sat in our car with nowhere to go. We were in there about 5 minutes or less...I say all this to say the owners and AIRBNB are giving us the run around and not refunding our money for the 8 days stay. (Over $1000) They keep saying they are working on it but then they close the chat with no resolution! These owners and AIRBNB are thieves. They buy trashy homes, put no work into it and rent it to people looking for a place to stay. It's predatory and unacceptable and just plain hurtful! I keep calling Airbnb and they keep saying the same thing, that they're escalating but it's all lies. They also keep sending me links that DON'T WORK.

They just wash hands off when their hosts make mistake. For keeping the customer out in the open in the middle of a cold night they offer 50 pound compensation.

Therefore, I contacted Airbnb's customer service again. In short: They called it ""merely an expression of experience"" and told me that no change of the review would be made.In my opinion: Airbnb doesn't really care if the reviews are truthful.

1608,Decade long superhost will not recommend Airbnb,"I'm a decade long superhost on Airbnb and now I will never recommend to anyone to list their property on their platform. I had a guest who damaged our property, violated our posted rules and the guest only partially paid for the cost to repair their damages. When I filed a reimbursement case for the remaining costs the guest did not cover and submitted all documentation showing the costs and damage, Airbnb decided they would only cover about 10% of it. Then when I asked questions as to how Airbnb reviews cases and where I can find their damage reimbursement review policies online, they retracted the 10% of additional coverage they initially offered and then closed my case. They were neither transparent nor supportive to a superhost who has brought them thousands of dollars over the last 10+ years. When I left an honest review of the guest so other hosts could be aware of the damages the guest caused, the guest complained to Airbnb and had the review removed with Airbnb stating I violated their policies of retaliatory reviews. I don't see how an honest review of a guest causing damages to a host property is retaliatory, but perhaps since I mentioned they refused to pay for the full cost of their damages, that is what Airbnb is saying is retaliatory? If you are thinking about hosting on Airbnb, heed my advice and consider something else. Even as a superhost, your status will not matter when you most need it to and their host reimbursement and insurance policy is a scam.

1621,Extremely Disappointing Experience with Airbnb and Host Negligence,"I recently stayed at an Airbnb that was advertised as a relaxing vacation home with a pool, but my experience turned into a series of unsafe conditions, lack of maintenance, and complete disregard from both the host and Airbnb.First, the lawn was wildly overgrown, despite multiple assurances from the host that it would be cut. It never was. The grass was so tall that we even spotted a snake in the yard. When the ""gardener"" finally arrived, he entered the backyard without warning, cursed at my mother, had a child with him (completely unprofessional), and then stole the lawn mower on the property. The host blatantly lied about this, claiming the gardener never spoke to us and that we were the ones making him uncomfortable—ridiculous, considering the man cursed at us in front of witnesses!Now, the most serious issue — the pool, which was advertised as a primary amenity, was unsafe. There was a light fixture with an exposed wire IN the pool that made the pool completely unusable for our family. I can't believe Airbnb didn’t take this more seriously. The host told us the pool was cleaned twice, but it was clear no pool service came, and we had to clean it ourselves. The host then contradicted herself in messages, stating the pool would be cleaned only after we left. Furthermore, the uneven bricks around the pool caused several of us to trip and roll our ankles. These aren’t minor inconveniences—these are safety hazards.Airbnb’s response to all of this? A pathetic offer of $200 after the host refused to provide any refund beyond $35. Seriously, $200 for a stay that was riddled with safety issues and lies? When I questioned how exposed wiring in a pool wasn't considered a big deal, I was met with the host’s word being taken at face value — apparently, if a host says something is okay, it just is. How is this acceptable?To make things worse, Airbnb has made every excuse under the sun to avoid addressing these issues properly. They’ve claimed that since the lawn was “outside the listing,” it doesn’t qualify for their AirCover policy, and despite being shown the exposed wire in the pool, they’re brushing it off.I work full-time and can’t always answer phone calls at Airbnb’s convenience, but the fact that they continue to ignore these very real safety concerns while hiding behind policy is infuriating. The host lied about so many details, and yet Airbnb acts as if that’s acceptable. Is this how they treat paying guests who rely on their platform for safety and quality?I’m deeply disappointed, not only with the host but with Airbnb itself. This experience has shattered my trust in their ability to uphold the standards they advertise. I would recommend anyone thinking of using Airbnb to be extremely cautious — don’t expect them to stand by you when things go wrong, even when your family's safety is at risk.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1631,If I could leave minus 5 stars I would,"If I could leave minus 5 stars I would. We have just returned from an horrendous stay in Azerbaijan where the host was the most unapproachable and rude host we have ever come across. This is in addition to the apartment having exposed screws, loose wiring right next to the shower which was life threatening, a fridge full of food that was past its sell by date, utensils and crockery that were full of grime and dirt and a bed that squeaked so loudly it was impossible to have any kind of sleep. It was horrendously bad and so we checked out early and booked into a local hotel.Since we have returned, the host has told a complete pack of lies about us which we can disprove on every level but luckily we have screenshots and pictures to support us with Airbnb so they will look after us right? WRONG!!!!!!!! Airbnb do not, repeat, do not care less about past guests, current guests or any future guests, they will do everything in their power to protect hosts because that is where their revenue comes from. We have had message after message from them saying that the hosts feedback doesn't violate any policies. In other words a host can tell lie after lie about guests and Airbnb will have their full backing!! We had exemplary 5 star feedback up until now but thanks to this host having a vendetta against us that has now been ruined and the blame lies solely at Airbnb's door for failing to protect guests when it can be proven beyond all unreasonable doubt that the host has told bare faced lies.Airbnb laughingly kept telling us that they empathise with us, they value us, they are there for us and they care about us but nothing could be further from the truth. They couldn't care less about guests and only care about themselves and their hosts. They may be the original company to set this sort of business up but there are far, far better ones out there who do actually care about their guests and their experiences, which is the complete opposite of Airbnb who have blatant disregard for their guests and couldn't care less about their experience when things go horribly wrong. So if you are reading this and are thinking of using Airbnb then please do yourself a favour and use a far more reputable site as Airbnb do not value guests in any way, shape or form. All they are interested in is protecting their hosts so they can earn more money from them. Airbnb DO NOT care about you, Airbnb DO NOT empathise with you, Airbnb DO NOT value guests and Airbnb will NEVER be there for you if you endure an horrendous experience.Their customer service has to be the worst I have ever come across and previous posts on here back up our review 100%. Their customer service for guests is non-existent. They incorrectly advised us from the very start telling us not to worry about any review being left because it would be removed if it was proven to be untrue and after that advice that is why we reported the host, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered as we didn't want negative feedback. Lo and behold they then backtracked and allowed the feedback to stay even though we have irrefutable proof that everything the host said was a complete and utter lie.Airbnd are a crass, loathsome, unsympathetic, uncaring, bigoted organisation who treat their guests like something they have on the bottom of their shoe. Avoid this utter joke of a company like the plague because if you have any issues at all they could not care less and will do everything in their power to support the host, their main revenue stream.

The host didn’t tell us he has already had full scale renovation, roof construction and builders arranged for the period we booked.Moved in on August 14th but as from early September it’s been a full scale building site with constant shouting, scaffolding being put up round the full building. No daylight coming into the apartment and having to keep blinds closed all day for privacy.  The noise makes it impossible to work from here as planned. They caused a leak in the apartment and the constant shouting and banging has got our dog stressed to the max.Contacted the host who denies knowing anything about the planned works even though he had the construction certificate pre authorised and dates booked till mid November already authorised by the planning department in San Francisco, and yet he still took the booking without warning us.Trying to get Airbnb to mediate and deal with it has been tiring and pointless to the point that we are having to cut short our trip and move out.

In reality, there are only three proper bedrooms, while the other two ""bedrooms"" are just connected to other rooms without any doors or walls. This is nowhere near what the listing promised.When I contacted customer service, I received unfriendly responses and was told they couldn't do anything. I don't understand how misleading information is allowed to be listed on Airbnb, and that I can’t even cancel my booking — which I made just a day ago! Instead of a full refund, they offered me a measly 70 Euros out of a total of 1,600 Euros.It’s absolutely outrageous that such false listings are allowed on the platform, and now the customer — myself — has to pay the price for it.

Everything was broken or about to break and it was miles away from anywhere. The owner was unfriendly and unhelpful. There was no reception. I could not reach Air BnB. I eventually got through to Air bnb after we were attacked by a swarm of wasps apparently living on the grotty porch. We had to go eat lunch in a restuarant as we didn't want to stay with the wasps. What a joke. Eventually got through to air bnb with the restaurants wifi etc. Airbnb canceleed our reservation without finding new accomodation so we were homeless. They sent us links to possible places. We examined them and picked one. They they didn't even explain but sent new links. At this stage we're now a few hours later and still at the restuarant. We found one but we had to go back to get our stuff from the dump of an appartment as airbnb had cancelled our reservation. Rushed back, got our stuff but once again couldnt get through to airbnb as no reception in that dump. Went back to the carpark of the expensive restaurant and tried to make new booking. Couldn't get airbnb to do it for us. They simply wouldn't and we had no/poor reception. Eventually we found something and I managed to contact the owner with zero useful help from airbnb. We went to a beach bar to have drinks whilst they cleaned that house. It cost way more money, we couldnt get anything else. Air bnb did not tell us that it was miles away. Eventually we went there to that place which was way too big and way too expensive. It was nice though and the owner was great. I dont hold him at all accountable but I do hold airbnb accountable. I have complained and complained, they refused to escalate my claim so now all I can do is take legal action. They do not care about you, your children, your safety. They are money making schemers and have no respect for their clients. Don't work for them, dont use them and don't rent your property via them. Home to Go are much, much better. Booking are dreadful as well. Try Kindred. I'll be doing that from now on. No more air bnb or booking for me. Unreliable, charlatons. Shocking! Imagine, we booked way on time and were sent to a dump that airbnb hadn't even checked (the girl on the phone actually told me), then they cancelled our dump reservation, sent us somewhere super expensive and very far away and refused to pay the difference, didn't even compensate us for having to eat and drink elsewhere.

1654,Can Airbnb get its house in order in supporting hosts?,"This is a review about Airbnb from the host's perspective. Initially, I liked the idea of being able to offer a top service (mostly five stars) whilst earning some extra income. I took my duty of care very seriously towards my guests.However, increasingly, I have begun to find Airbnb unresponsive and not supportive enough at crucial times. As well as great hosting experiences, have had some horrendous times with guests, inclusive of flooding the place, burning a matress, leaving a stove lit (in absence) doors left open etc, etc. After a hostile, confrontational encounter with a guest (ten months ago), who booked  a single room, wanted to move a woman in, I have not hosted despite only having my savings to live on.Airbnb ""SECURITY"" alert system didn't work. Nor was there any follow-up, support, concern or checking in as to how the experience left me. I now almost have a phobia about hosting again.Added to that is the lack of contact with respect to getting Airbnb to reflect. Added to that is what I perceive to be a thinly-veiled authoritarianism with respect to whether a host can turn down a potential guest. I feel strongly that there is a hidden weighting behind the guest because they are the cash potential. They can burn your house down but they will be able to locate elsewhere, after all, whereas to lose the cash potential is more problematic. I need to know Airbnb have my back which will be to the benefit of all.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2

This was only my second time booking through the platform, and I was excited to stay in a nice place in the heart of Rome’s old town. However, my booking was canceled at the last minute due to “concerns about the quality and reliability of the listing.” This cancellation happened just a week before my trip, leaving me with very little time to find alternatives. To make matters worse, there was no proper compensation—just a £20 coupon, which can only be used on bookings over £984.32 and expires in one month. This feels completely inadequate given the inconvenience and stress caused.I will likely avoid using Airbnb in the future and would advise others to be cautious.

1657,"Airbnb Birmingham In house Robbery, they have the Key!","I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a distressing experience my husband and I had while staying at an Airbnb property. We booked this accommodation for three nights (sunday-wednesday) as a temporary transit, as we would receive the keys to our new home on Wednesday.The main reason we chose this listing was due to the friendly appearance of the hosts, Helen and Ally, who are presented as two warm, smiling white women on Airbnb. However, upon our arrival on Sunday at 3 PM, we were met not by them but by a man who did not match the hosts’ descriptions. He gave us a tour of the property and handed us a bottle of wine, saying, “I hope you drink it.” We accepted his goodwell.Later that evening, after moving our last few luggages in around 6 PM, my husband opened the wine. After tasting it, I felt dizzy and went to bed early around 9pm, while my husband only consumed half of the bottle before feeling sleepy himself.Around 2 AM, I suddenly woke up to find two men in this property—one holding the door and the other rummaging through our belongings. I screamed, and they yelled, “Go, go, go!” before fleeing the scene. My husband chased after them, but they had already disappeared. To our shock, my husband found the key still in the lock—they had forgotten it!We were terrified and immediately called the police, who helped us change the locks. We discovered that our belongings had been stolen, including an iPhone 14 Plus, headphones, £200 in cash, my engagement pure gold ring, a pure gold bracelet, two debit cards, and five credit cards. Alarmingly, we received notifications that our stolen credit cards had already been used within an hour of the theft.On Monday afternoon, we informed the host about the incident. However, the same man who initially met us—claiming to be the “site manager”—was the one who came to address our concerns. His response was dismissive: “You can leave if you want, or stay if you want; the police have changed the locks, and the house is now safe.” When I asked to speak with Helen and Ally, he informed me that their information on Airbnb was fake and that the photos were randomly sourced. He claimed the actual host was just one of their employees!Feeling unsafe and no longer trusting the accommodation, we decided to leave. I contacted Airbnb for assistance around 4 AM after the police left. The initial call went smoothly; I explained that my phone was stolen and that I could not access my Airbnb account or email. I provided my husband’s email and phone number, and the representative assured me they would follow up via email. However, I never received anything.I made a total of four calls that evening, all of which promised a prompt response that never came. Today, after another attempt, a customer service representative finally sent an email to my husband’s address, but I found out that multiple messages had been sent to my Airbnb inbox from a no-reply address. I am unable to respond because I cannot log in to my account due to the theft.It is incredibly frustrating that the customer service representatives seem unable to comprehend my situation. To date, no progress has been made, and I am still receiving requests to recount my experience through messages that I cannot reply to. Each time I am forced to relive the trauma, remembering the faces of the intruders, which affects my mental well-being. I now struggle to sleep naturally, relying on medication for rest, and we are currently staying in an expensive hotel for safety.I urge you to take this matter seriously and provide assistance in resolving this situation.

Again, this was a positive review. I gave the stay 4 stars and provided constructive feedback privately to the owner as to what they might consider improving. Long story longer, Airbnb determined that they would remove my rating and review. I objected, as it was honest and professional, completely appropriate. It doesn't take long to see that the host simply wasn't happy with a 4 star review, and was willing to lie to get it removed. This is nuts!

After booking on March 1/24, I received a confirmation that matched.  Two week s prior to the Aug. 30/24 booking I logged into my AIRBNB account to send the host a message to confirm.  I received a message back verifying all details.  Everything seemed to be in order.That's when it fell apart.3 days before checkin, the host calls me to say that there was a ""miscommunication"".  She was not apologetic or remorseful, just simply rude.  Although I had booked a 6 bedroom home, I would only have access to 4 bedrooms.  Apparently the basement suit was rented to someone else.  I explained that I had booked the entire house and was paying the rate of the entire property, not 4 bedrooms.  She then proceeded to say that as a host if she had to move the basement tenants it would cost her money and I would need to pay more.  She said she would check if tenant would move.The day of checkin arrived and I received instructions and verification that I would have access to the basement.  A key would be in the door that separated the units when I arrived.  Upon checkin, the key was in fact in the basement door, so I believed that all was resolved.Long story short, the host entered the property on two occasions without knocking or identifying themselves knowing full well we were in the property.  Host was vicious, screaming and yelling.  Threatening and bullying to leave the entire premises.I contacted AIRBNB support and after 6.5 hours was informed that I would be allowed to stay.  The event we had planned that evening was missed.I have contacted AIRBNB many times since this incident to ask what they plan to do regarding their host being fradulent and trying to shake me down for more money.

1672,WARNING,"WARNING: Trust these reviews. Do not use Airbnb, and avoid the host named Helen. She has several properties in Biloxi Mississippi. My complaint concerns Helen's poor attitude and substandard living conditions at her Airbnb. Additionally, the Airbnb customer support team repeatedly charged my credit card without my authorization. Taking money off my credit card when they were not supposed to. This prompted my bank to alert me and necessitate the cancellation of my card.  Do not trust the Airbnb with your card information. They are out to take your money. Regarding the host, Helen, and her Airbnb in Biloxi, Mississippi, her lack of customer service was notable. She made us vacate the Airbnb early and declined to issue a refund. She literally put of out even though we had already paid. I have evidence that she made us leave early without issuing a refund, as Airbnb customer support has sent us a letter apologizing for not properly processing our refund. Furthermore, the state of the Airbnb was not up to par. Helen driveway was unsightly with large potholes. The whole driveway was in need of repair. Also, it is important to highlight that the driveway repairs commenced only following this bad review, however, it still need work done to it. Additionally, the living room futon displayed prominent stains on the cushion, requiring a cover before use because we had no idea what caused the stains. We did know if the stain was human secretions or not. Moreover, the old refrigerator consistently flooded the floor, and its door detached entirely upon opening. Once again, the entire door fell right off the hinges upon being opened. This resulted in some food items spoiling, and even upon departure, it was still not functioning correctly. Regarding Helen, she was a horrible host. If you read her previous reviews on the Airbnb website it reveals descriptions of her as unscrupulous and mentions of her unpleasant demeanor. I sincerely hope my review remains visible, as it's a common concern that some businesses may remove negative reviews. The public has a right to know the truth, and issues can only be addressed when they are exposed. So, I would not recommend anyone to stay at one of Helen Airbnb in Biloxi MS or even the Airbnb company to stay anywhere because the company is untrustworthy. Lastly, I have posted some picture of Helen driveway. I really wish Trustpliot had the ability to post photos.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1677,HORRIBLE SUPPORT,"I had a highly disappointing experience with Airbnb due to both their policies and support services. I booked a room for 10 days, but upon arrival, I found the room in terrible condition—dirty, infested with spiders and insects, and clearly not as described in the listing. There was even hair on the bed, despite paying over £50 in cleaning fees.When I raised these issues with the host, they dismissed my concerns, claiming it was normal for UK homes to have spiders, as if that excused the poor cleanliness and misrepresentation.I contacted Airbnb support for a refund, but my request was declined. I then asked for a partial refund and to modify my stay to just one day. However, Airbnb's policy required the host’s approval first, which is extremely frustrating given that the host had already been dishonest in the listing. After leaving me without help for four hours, Airbnb support finally offered £150 as compensation, which didn’t even cover 20% of my booking costs.In short, Airbnb's policy protects dishonest hosts at the expense of guests, and their support team is unhelpful when issues arise. If you're considering paying a large sum for an Airbnb, I recommend saving yourself the hassle and opting for a hotel instead, where you’re more likely to get what you pay for.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I received cut and paste nonsense that was of no help in me booking another place that was affordable. £20 wasn’t going to make even a tiny dent in rebooking 9 days in advance when all affordable places were booked out! The customer service agent rang me, though she was difficult to hear and understand. She rushed to say she had refunded my money and repeated their bs offer of a £20 coupon. You could tell she was just reading a script and could care less. She said she would send equivalent properties and proclaimed my issue resolved and hung up. I looked at her suggested properties and cried. They were all insanely expensive! I then got another message saying how happy they were to resolve my issue and they were there for me 24/7. They closed my complaint to their satisfaction.Meanwhile, I’m still left high and dry with nowhere to stay with my 5yo daughter, no refund has arrived in my bank account and I’m a week from departure.

They seem to forget that it is the hosts who take the biggest risk, not to mention without hosts and their homes, platforms such as Airbnb would be out of business.- Arbitrary decisions without prior warning.

Even when you do get a hold of customer service with BDC, the problem normally is unresolved. AirBnB customer service, at least for super hosts, seems to respond within a few hours. BDC doesn't seem to care about customers or hosts as long as the commission is paid. The same complaints are reported in other hosting groups.

As a legal and responsible operator in Portugal, I provided all the insurance documents required by Portuguese law, including liability insurance, boat insurance, and personal accident insurance.After a long wait and numerous attempts to communicate with the support team, I received a response stating that my insurance was not adequate and that a specific ""maritime insurance"" was required. However, in Portugal, there is no insurance with such a designation. Portuguese insurers offer exactly the types of insurance I have already submitted to Airbnb, which are fully legal and valid for operating my business.I have been trying to resolve this situation for more than 20 days. I have sent several emails, made more than 10 phone calls, and the only response I receive is to ""wait."" The chat with the support team has been unhelpful, with automated or empty responses, without any concrete solution. This incompetence on the part of the support team is causing me daily financial losses, as I cannot operate my experience and am losing customers and revenue.I demand that Airbnb resolves this situation immediately. As a partner who generates significant revenue for the platform through the commissions paid on each experience sold, I feel disrespected and undervalued by the lack of response and solution. If my insurance is legal and valid in Portugal, and there is no clarity on what type of ""maritime"" insurance is required, Airbnb needs to recognize and accept the documents I have already provided, or give clear and feasible instructions.I am awaiting an urgent response and the immediate reactivation of my experience.

The conditions were so unsafe that we couldn’t stay in the unit and had to book a hotel at our own expense.As a mother of two babies, this was an added burden during an already tragic time—I had just lost my daughter and was there for her celebration of life. On top of the emotional distress, we suffered significant financial losses, including spoiled groceries, hotel costs, and paying for an electrician—expenses that Airbnb and the host have refused to compensate after host asked us to pay and promised daily that the maintenance man would arrive.This experience was a blatant breach of guest safety, habitability, and financial reimbursement rights.

Once the host finally replied after AirBNB contacting them, he stated that he is unsure why we were able to book. This makes no sense as we booked 5 days prior to arriving so surely he would have seen the money come to his account? Or even an email confirming that someone has booked. We were given no indication that the apartment would have been unavailable as we were sent a confirmation stating that the host had accepted it. It was 8pm and I was sitting at a abandoned bus stop with my luggage, bearing in mind I’m a young girl and anything could have happened especially considering I am in a area I have never been too! Alternative solutions were provided from Airbnb which consisted of apartments that were 1-2 hours away from where I had booked and pre planned activities had to be cancelled, due to this it resulted in me losing out on £200 as I did not get this money back! Even with these alternation apartments provided, it was not certain I would have this apartment for sure as they told me to call the host and ask if they can have me so I was still stranded on the street finding solutions. They also said they would not pay for my travel to the other apartments which were more than an hour away when I was not at fault so service was disgustingly poor!

Also the photos of the apartments interiors on airbnb  are often not the same as when you check-in. Definitely not letting it fly anymore.  My previous stay had black mould all over the bathroom tiles and I had to complain and get a cleaner in  immediately on arriving.

Because we didn't have enough money to just book somewhere else ourselves, me and my friends (females) were left in a flat we didn’t feel safe in overnight (we used every pair of socks we had to try cover all the cameras). Airbnb then rang me at midnight and admitted they had made an error in processing our move so it couldn't happen until the next day. The host then tried to take money out of my account so I had to cancel all my bank cards while in a foreign country, and Airbnb said this had nothing to do with them so they wouldn't help me. This was all extremely distressing. Airbnb promised a full refund, but I’ve only been given a partial refund, which they calculated incorrectly twice. I’ve also had multiple messages and emails ignored, and been spoken to rudely on the phone by about 12 different Airbnb staff. To top it all, they allowed the host straight back on the platform and allowed him to give me a negative review. I haven't ever dealt with such an awful level of customer service and I was shocked that even when they admit someone has broken their policies, tried to steal from you, and film you without your consent, this individual can be allowed back on the platform hosting the same property out.

However, it sometimes (very rarely) happens that guests simply demand their money back by making demonstrably false claims. Instead of investigating the case properly, as a host you are completely left in the lurch by Airbnb and hung on the rope of a guest's lies, which is more than unpleasant. Airbnb is always on the side of the guest, even if obviously false information is provided, and then justifies this with freedom of expression. Behind this is the fact that superhosts are “bludgeoned” into even greater efforts by these bad reviews or payments and that the company doesn't care about the people/hosts at all. Even the support team admits that Airbnb relies on a self-serving model. But anyone who invests a lot as a super host so that guests are completely happy is demotivated and undermined by this system and the extremely negative experiences it causes. Customer loyalty looks completely different!Ich bin seit Jahren Superhost bei Airbnb und meistens sehr zufrieden mit der Arbeit und den Gästen.

Airbnb steht immer auf der Seite des Gastes, auch wenn offensichtlich falsche Angaben gemacht werden und rechtfertigt das dann mit Meinungsfreiheit. Dahinter steht das Superhosts von diesen schlechten Bewertungen oder Zahlungen zu noch größeren Anstrengungen „geknüppelt“ werden und das die Menschen/Hosts dem Konzern dabei völlig egal sind.

After she sent out the bug man (yes, it had ants, even in the cupboards, on the counters, table in the kitchen, we felt things crawling on us in the living room), we never stopped contacting the host. We wanted to have many family dinners together but that plan got thrown out with the rest of our plans to enjoy spending time together in a nice clean home. The fridge didn't have ants. Upon arrival I sent the host pics of stains on the white carpet going from the garbage can in the kitchen to the front door - more ant invitation! A previous review mentions trash not being removed. Then the A/C gave out and we were expected to cancel our birthday plans to meet the repairman. There were thick layers of dust on the filter that should have been changed out in March 2024. So that filthy filter pumped lots of dirt into the air conditioning all summer long. No wonder it broke. Costly oversight. Our trip was ruined.

A deep dive into the host’s reviews ended up revealing a pattern of similar behaviour and other scams. After trying to claim over $800 in damages for a window blind that had been taken off the track, we tried to resolve the issue with Airbnb, showing that we had made the host aware of issues that we did find present (there was a tear in the couch and the dryer wasn’t functioning) but this damage was not us. We also showed them the multiple other instances of shady business the host had done. Airbnb originally claimed that there wasn’t sufficient evidence to find us responsible but they were going to reimburse the host themselves and close the matter. Fast forward a few days later and now Airbnb is claiming we are fully responsible and need to reimburse them for the money they sent the host. The lack of consistency and what honestly just seems like trying to make back their money in spite of lack of clear evidence shows they can be just as shady as the hosts they collect their fees from.

Despite multiple attempts to rectify the situation directly with the host and seeking assistance from Airbnb's customer support, the problems have persisted, leading to considerable inconvenience and distress.I booked an Airbnb property with the expectation that it would meet the standards and amenities outlined in the listing and as per Airbnb's policies. Unfortunately, upon arrival, I discovered several issues that have made my stay deeply uncomfortable. Firstly, the apartment was poorly cleaned, with a foul odor throughout the space. The poor ventilation in the apartment exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to get fresh air and creating an unpleasant living environment. Additionally, the common areas of the building are poorly maintained, with both the hallways and other shared spaces being inadequately cleaned and emitting unpleasant smells.Furthermore, the property was severely under-equipped, with several essential items missing. The missing items include:Cleaning supplies (broom, bucket, cleaning cloths, and cleaning products)A trash bin for the bathroomDish towelsSufficient pots and cooking utensilsA kettleBath towels for a two-week stayBathroom matsIt occurred on: 10/08/2024I promptly communicated these issues to the host, requesting that the missing items be provided immediately. However, the host failed to address the majority of my concerns. The reception at the building provided only one bath towel and one pot, which is entirely inadequate. I was further informed that I would need to contact the host directly for any additional items, which I did, but to no avail.In a particularly humiliating experience, I was directed by the host to visit the building’s reception, where a staff member led me to a cluttered room filled with various items resembling a pile of trash. I was told to pick out anything I needed for the apartment, leading me to take one bath towel, some plates, bowls, and a pot. This experience was demeaning and far from the standard of service and accommodation I expected.Despite raising these issues with Airbnb's support team, I have not received an adequate resolution. The host has not fulfilled their obligations, and Airbnb has not provided the necessary intervention to rectify the situation or offer alternative accommodation that meets the expected standards.I am seeking assistance in ensuring that Airbnb takes immediate and appropriate action to resolve this matter. Specifically, I request that Airbnb enforce the provision of the missing essential items, particularly the cleaning supplies, or facilitate a move to a suitable alternative accommodation that meets the promised standards. If Airbnb fails to resolve this issue, I believe it reflects a systemic problem with their customer service and host accountability practices.I look forward to your prompt response on this matter.Booking reference  HMHXB92DNJFlat 231,Dashwood Studios 126 Walworth RoadSE171JL",Rated 2 out of 5 stars,2

However, the owner canceled the reservation at 7:00 PM, leaving us with almost no time to find alternative accommodation in the city. Airbnb's initial solution was to find another apartment, but due to the late hour and limited options, we couldn't secure anything.After informing Airbnb support that we were unable to find another place, they suggested booking a hotel room (which, at that time, were all very expensive) and offered us an additional $300 to cover hotel costs. We understood that this $300 was meant to cover both nights we had originally booked in Dubrovnik.The only option we found was an apartment on Booking.com that was much more expensive than the one we had booked through Airbnb ($811). Additionally, because of how late it was, we had to eat at a restaurant, which cost more than we had planned, and we also had to get an Uber because the new apartment was far from where we initially intended to stay.To make matters worse, the address of the Airbnb apartment we originally rented was very unclear. This caused us to wander around, walking a lot, and when the Uber dropped us off at what we thought was the correct location, we had to climb numerous stairs—Dubrovnik is full of them. This led to a friend of ours, who has a back injury, asking us to urgently find a pharmacy for painkillers because his pain became unbearable.All of this happened around midnight in a city we had never been to before, putting us in a potentially dangerous situation, including the risk of being robbed or worse.I demand that Airbnb reconsider the entire case and the way they handled the situation that night in Dubrovnik, as it was dealt with in a very inhumane manner.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Than, walking around the cabin we noticed there was no usable firepit with benches, a usable gazebo, or a usable zipline & pond like advertised in the Airbnb photos. A leak in the basement made the family room unusable, which was the only room in the house for a large group of people to relax in. There was a leak under the kitchen sink making a puddle to the floor. Foul odors were coming from 2 of the rooms like something had died, grime covered the kitchen table, and dirt plugged up air filters downstairs to the point they weren’t working properly.The owner got back to us and said he was calling their handyman. The handyman showed up Monday, 2 days later. We had family who flew in from Texas for the weekend and we did not get what we paid for. The house was not in a safe condition. The place seemed to be in a state of disrepair and neglect. The photos on Airbnb’s website for this property should either be updated or removed due to inaccuracy. We would have left the next day, but the owners were so slow getting back to us with a solution and we had so little time with our family that we just made do and kept the kids out of the basement. We requested an $800 refund. Not quite half of the cost because we only got about half of the service. Airbnb told us they were only mediators and couldn’t offer more than $250 discount from the buyer or $375 from Airbnb itself. Since we are able to back up all these issues with photos I told Airbnb Customer Service to have a Supervisor call me because I wanted the full amount requested. The Airbnb rep on the phone said he was only authorized to offer us $375. I was told a supervisor would call yesterday, then again today. It is now 6:30pm where I am and no call. My next step is to take it up with my credit card company to see if I have any recourse.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1813,Why isn’t there a category for zero…,"Why isn’t there a category for zero stars?Was in Paris for 2 days - for the Olympics.  Made my reservation approx a year ago.  Turned up, no code and entry.  Tried to call the host, no luck.  Called airbnb and the guy told me I’d have to wait an hour.  After an hour, they could not get hold of the host but apparently he just cancelled the booking.Airbnb offered me 3 options ‘apparently’ nearby, similar offering and pricing.  Not true and I was already late for a meeting without traipsing round Paris in mid 30s C heat, with bags.  So I found a hotel, luckily.  Bear in mind, it’s the Olympics so imagine the surge pricing.  For airbnb to try and compare their pathetic ‘similar price and similar offering in the same area’ is laughable.My ‘amazing’ compensation was a full refund plus a whole 20% off my next booking.  And up to EUR50 off a snack/drinks.  You have to be kidding me with the ‘next booking’.I was asked for a review.  Wrote it over a week ago, still not published.  Wonder about the transparency???????Apparently the host was ‘punished’ by not being able to rent out the apartment for the days I was meant to be there and he lost his superhost status.  That’s it?  Seems like they care more about him than my experience.Meanwhile, I had a rude person in customer ‘support’ call me and was basically patronising and accusatory.  I got some money back from my cafe but not all (ie not the tip).  They sent a link but no explanation why no hotel refund nor why no tip.  When I asked, they just cut and pasted the response.  Why I would even think about using this company again after this horrific incident is beyond me.As companies go, mistakes happen.  How airbnb addresses issues is the sign of its worth. Judging by my experience and reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder about why this company is still in existence.As someone who runs her own company and knows how important our customers are for the longevity of the business, this is a sure fire way of guaranteeing this company is entering the ‘SELL’ recommendation or is ripe for a LT downgrade in ratings.

1817,As an Airbnb host,"As an Airbnb host, I’ve had an incredibly disappointing experience with the company. Despite their promises of support and security for property owners, they have proven to be completely irresponsible.When issues arose with a guest who caused significant damage to my property, Airbnb’s response was frustratingly slow and inadequate. They failed to provide any meaningful assistance or compensation, leaving me to handle the situation on my own. It’s clear that Airbnb does not prioritize the well-being of their hosts, despite us being a crucial part of their business.Their customer service is virtually nonexistent, with long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and a complete lack of accountability. It feels like they are more interested in collecting their fees than in actually supporting the hosts who make their platform possible.If you’re considering renting out your property on Airbnb, I would strongly advise against it. The risks far outweigh any potential benefits, and you’re likely to be left without support when you need it most.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I told the host about their dog which is a support dog for my daughter and was also classed as hypoallergenic.  The host accepted this and all was well until after they had booked in.My husband I went with them to book in and I was horrified to find that they could not use the lounge because it had no furniture and the kitchen because it had no utensils, crockery, cutlery or cooking equipment and the cooker was disconnected.We all returned to my home and I sent an email complaining about this which I now admit it was a bit 'over the top' as I was so disappointed and upset.I then received the following message from the host to say that,""Airbnb are fully aware of the violations within this stay, and that you have vacated.*using areas within my home that are not included within my listing. (Living room/kitchen including fridge)* allowing a dog to roam freely around the whole property again when I have not included that space and ask specifically not to as I have severe allergies.I will now go ahead and have to have my whole apartment cleaned thoroughly.""I think the word 'violations' is hard as no body had shown any disrespect to his property, only looking in the lounge to find it was totally lacking in furniture and looking in the kitchen to find that there were no utensils, crockery, cutlery or cooking equipment there.) I don't think the word 'used' is appropriate here - they did not use it, they only looked.  He accepted their dog so long as it was not allowed on go on the furniture/bed which they strictly adhered to.  She slept on a blanket on the floor.At that stage, before we received his email, due to my mistake, none of us had realised we were doing any wrong.Later he saw my daughter in the street and told her that he had seen a black dog lead in the lounge window sill - he hadn't because her lead was red!I was horrified to say the least when I read his comments but I now know that it was all my fault and I explained that I had seen the lovely photos of his accommodation and was concerned that someone else would book it first.  In my anxiety, I failed to read some of the information that the lounge and kitchen were not to be used because of ongoing renovations.I emailed back and apologised most profusely for my complaint and told him that it was a genuine mistake in booking his apartment.  I also told him that this was supposed to be a special treat for my daughter (who, incidentally, has had a life-threatening diagnosis - I told him this in another email). She lives in Cornwall and it is two years since I saw her and her family due to various problems with my and my husband's health.He then phoned me and said I could pay the full amount and not use the lounge or kitchen, or they could leave immediately and I would receive reimbursement for the nights they did not stay.I told him that they would move out immediately which they did, but I did not receive the whole amount.  This I did not query as I was extremely upset at the time and wanted an end to the whole stressful experience.I gave an excellent review of his accommodation, not mentioning the strong words he used such as violations and his severe allergies 'so he would have to have the apartment cleaned thoroughly' and saying they had been 'using' the rooms.  They had not because they were definitely unusable.I thought that was the end of it but I was very wrong.He then gave me the following review:""Unfortunately I would not recommend Bronwen to other hosts. Bronwen and Family completely over stepped the mark by ignoring my house rules using parts of my home that is not included even though this was made clear at time of booking! Allowing there dog to freely roam my home when I had kindly allowed the dog to stay in the rooms designated at the time of booking. I was left with no choice but to end  their stay early.""He did not end the stay early, I did""  He offered to let them stay if I paid extra, so because of the unusable areas, I told them they would leave immediately, which they did.I assume that now if I try to book an Airbnb, no one will want to accept it.

The damp had damaged the skirting boards,  the windowsills and all the cabinets in the kitchen. There was mould growing on the skirting boards and on the exposed brickwork. We also were not made aware of the fact there was construction directly opposite the AirBnB that would start extremely early in the morning and would wake up from our sleep. We noticed that there were small black stones in the tap water so elected to drink only bottled water. The sofa was covered in several stains. As a result we decided against sitting on the sofa during our stay. The towels were also stained. Unfortunately, we left our wallet in the accommodation by accident.

1834,Airbnb is a scam,"Airbnb is a scam.It is important for all Airbnb guests to be aware that there is no protection in case your host cancel, including at the last minute. In brief it means that Airbnb is only after your money and doesn't care about you, as a customer, if the host decides to cancel (including for basic reasons such as water damages due to leaks, faulty roof etc.). Airbnb's top priority will be to refund you to ensure it no longer has any (legal) liability. They will first insult you by offering a voucher of 20$ for finding an alternative accommodation. In case of last-minute cancellation (within 7 days of stay), they will offer a voucher for up to 50% of the original booking. If you are unlucky, you will not be able to find alternative accommodation at short notice. If you are ""lucky"" to find alternative accommodation, this voucher will not cover the additional cost associated to a last minute booking and you will end up thousands of dollars out of pocket. To the best of my knowledge, no insurance will cover for this situation. It is also worth being aware that Airbnb failed to pro-actively cancelled the existing reservations (including mine) after detecting that the host went rogue. If you'd like peace of mind for your holidays, do not use Airbnb (until the CEO/company culture changes). I would strongly encourage to use Expedia instead, which puts its customers at the heart of its business each time an issue arises.

A email of complaint has been sent but I don't expect a response, reality is if he had set sofa up as a bed this would of fallen directly on his skull they will be hearing from our solicitor.It clearly states on there the reservation booking for the house and reservation, appears that the customers that you deal with are not important as it's taken over two hours for me to report a serious accident that happened at one of your premises booked through airbnb and we are still no further forward..We called airbnb, we spoke to a gentleman called Michael, he was not willing to give us his last name, he stated during that call that we needed the book in reference number and would call us back within 20 minutes  to give us time to obtain that booking number so he could apparently help us further and forward the call to the relevant department,that call never happened.After obtaining that booking reference number my partner called airbnb back after 40 minutes and we got the same all handler Michael, after going round and round in circles and him stating that the booking reference number wasn't accessible through your systems I then took over the call as my partner was getting more distressed and rightfully so after this ordeal, I asked him why he didn't return the call after 20 minutes as he specified, he claimed that it was down to technical difficulties with the system to the reasons why he could not call us back, it's questionable if he ever intended to call us back, I asked to speak to a manager which he declined to do.What is concerning that is that the line we went through was pacifically for safety issues.my partner Daniel was awoken sharply at 2.30/3am by a shelf falling off the wall that held over approximately  30 encyclopedias that fell directly on top of him, fortunately he had fallen asleep watching a film and not pulled out the bed as it was designed, the reality is this could have been fatal as the shelf and the content would have fallen directly onto his skull, during this incident he has seriously obtained serious injuries to his arm and face and is extremely shook up and traumatised, he is currently at the hospital awaiting to be seen by a doctor to check whether the arm is broken, in all the years of our relationship have I even seen that grown man cry like I have today, so based on that it's clear the impact this has had on him physically and mentally.We have spoken to the owner of the property directly who has been extremely helpful and empathetic to Danny and us as a family, Lizzie was clearly distraught in our conversation on the phone I can't say the same for Airbnb.I made a last attempt with Airbnb and spoke to a gentleman called mayuresh and the same information was given to him with reguarding to the booking and in incident and the same response was given to the situation, infact we were told to call back Monday when Danny's supervisor would be available to make the call with my husband, what kind of response is that! It is unsure whether Danny will be accessing work for the foreseeable so we are unsure when this information sharing will be happening at this stage. In this situation there should be  a more accessible process, we were unable to log Danny's details due to this, let alone the impact of his injuries, the priority should have been with Danny to get him to an emergency room and is injuries checked not having to go through these difficulties with airbnb,this should be able to be done promptly luckily we have the direct number for the house owner otherwise she too would of had no information reguarding this about her property or the situation reguarding my husband, so she also has been let down too, im sure she pays you to manage her property and any issues that arrise this is also unacceptable across the board not only to her but us too, we have a duty of care to her property to report it to Airbnb and equally as a customer be able to report serious situations like this about your customers which this appalling service have prevented.I look forward to hearing from you promptly, communication will happen directly to the house owner directly as you have not given us the platform to do this through yourselves.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

I suggest people doing AIRBNB to make extra income start using their profits for necessary things instead of throwing away what they make and trying to live in a house that's not in the rich area and trying to keep up with the Joneses next door to impress them because if you are a host spending that money on your week family vacation instead of doing repairs to your house.. that's really not my problem.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,3

They don't care how dirty and run down a place is (no ventilation in kitchen or bathroom, for example) and don't even get me started about the extra fees they allow hosts to charge outside of the agreed rate.

1904,A Traveler's Nightmare: How Airbnb Failed to Protect Me from Assault,"**Review of Airbnb: A Cautionary Tale of Safety and Accountability**I am writing this review to share a deeply troubling and horrifying experience I had with Airbnb. As a single woman traveling in a foreign country, I expected a safe and secure stay when I booked through Airbnb. Unfortunately, my experience turned into a nightmare.During my stay, I was physically attacked by the host. In a state of shock and fear, I immediately reported the incident to Airbnb, believing they would take swift and serious action. I was sorely mistaken. Instead of receiving the support and protection I needed, I was met with a bureaucratic nightmare.Airbnb initially promised to investigate the incident. However, I was continuously given the runaround, with no real updates or progress. A week later, to my utter disbelief, I received an email stating that my account had been blocked. No further information regarding the assault was provided. This response was not only inadequate but utterly insulting, considering the gravity of the situation.I am disgusted by Airbnb's treatment of my case and their handling of such a serious incident. It is clear that they prioritize their hosts over the safety and well-being of their guests. As a traveler, you expect the platform you use to take responsibility and ensure your safety, especially in a foreign country where you are most vulnerable.I strongly urge everyone to avoid using Airbnb for their accommodations. The company's inability to protect its guests and their blatant disregard for the severity of assault is appalling. Safety should always be a top priority, and Airbnb has failed miserably in this regard. Do not put yourself at risk; choose a company that values and safeguards its customers.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

1907,Amazing Window View 2Room Apartment by Andel Metro,"DON'T. BOOK.(The title is the Airbnb so you do not book him)Me and my 2 closest friends decided to travel to Prague, and need an apartment for 2 nights. We saw Cyril's flat, and since the price was relatively cheap, we booked it, as well as paid for the cleaning fee, beforehand.From the start, it wasn’t apparent that Cyril was playing a facade, continuously acting super-generous and easy to contact. He dropped by the apartment and helped us sign some immigrant/vacation-papers, he even pointed out that we should feel at home, and we “of course” could use the necessities we needed. More about the apartment in the last paragraph.The 2 nights pass by, and we message the owner that we’re leaving. And even though we had already paid for the cleaning, we still fixed and made the fixing, easy for him. Including throwing all trash into bins, hanging the towels back, leaving the glasses in the sink, and making sure nothing was out of place.Fast forward 3 hours, and we receive an additional request of about 4000 CZK (about an 50% extra of the total fee), for “additional cleaning”. He attaches images of a bottle, a sock and glasses being in the sink, and claims 1800 CZK for them being out of place. 1800 CZK. Furthermore, he attaches images of (according to him) one 5-year old sleeping blanket with a green/ turquoise stain and a black mark (that easily goes away in the wash, since blankets should be washed after usage), and claims we are responsible for the stains. We agree on that the black stain might have come from some type of spillage from a drink, so we agree that we could pay, if the stain doesn’t go away in the wash.Cyril adds two more images, of normal dirt on two different towels. It must be quite apparent that if there are hanging towels in the bathroom, they will be used? Do we have to pay extra 500 CZK, for towel usage? Especially when, it’s just normal, dirty towels?The apartment itself was relatively similar to the pictures and description on the site, but I find it kinda confusing that the silverfish, insects, garbage outside the main door, the odor from the stairwell that goes into the apartment, the lift that almost breaks every time you need to enter the 5th floor, the shadiness of how you gather the keys, the graffiti on all walls when you take the stairs, the windows that needs to be forced open if you want some type of oxygen, the lack of air conditioning, or the disgusting smell that’s coming from the bedroom? He must have forgotten adding it to the description. Thinking back, we are convinced that neither the sheets, towels or anything that needs to be cleaned, has been cleaned before arrival.If it isn’t clear, this is a risk NOT worth taking.I'm writing this one because Airbnb deleted my comment on Cyril's account. So if i manage's to save one from experiencing what happened to me, I'm happy. And the reason I'm giving Airbnb 1 star is that they deleted my comment where I complained about my stay and they left his comment filled with lies up on my profile, which will result in complications with my next stay.Poor customer support on this one, if this happens to you, document everything and if you suspects your host of being shady.

1911,Unethical and unregulated,"As a loyal Airbnb customer for over 10 years, my recent experience with Airbnb's handling of a negative review left by a host has been profoundly disappointing and frustrating.I booked a stay at Night Pastures in West Sussex, where the host provided a non-functional contact number, failed to deliver essential information through the Airbnb platform, and encouraged us to leave reviews on external sites like TripAdvisor. These actions, which violate Airbnb’s own guidelines, led to significant communication difficulties and a very unpleasant stay.Despite my numerous attempts to resolve these issues through Airbnb support, including providing evidence and clear documentation of the host's violations, my concerns were initially acknowledged, and the negative review left by the host on my profile was removed. However, without a satisfactory explanation, the review was later reinstated.The host’s negative review criticised me for excessive messaging and late arrival—issues directly caused by the host’s own shortcomings. This retaliatory review unfairly tarnished my reputation, despite the host being at fault. Airbnb's support team initially agreed with my concerns, but then inexplicably reversed their decision, reinstating the unfair review.This back-and-forth process, filled with misleading assurances and unfulfilled promises, has been extremely frustrating. Airbnb's support team has shown a lack of accountability and regulatory responsibility. Furthermore, their suggestion to respond to the review was redundant, as I had already done so.The behaviour of both the host and Airbnb in this situation has been unethical, reflecting poorly on Airbnb’s commitment to maintaining a fair and trustworthy review system. It is clear that genuine customer concerns and loyalty are not valued, and this has left me reconsidering my future with Airbnb.I expected more from a platform that I have trusted for over a decade. This experience has been a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and customer support, both of which Airbnb has severely lacked in this instance.I hope this review helps others be cautious and highlights the need for Airbnb to revisit its policies and customer service practices to truly support and value its users.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

This is simply so that host can obtain a higher price for the booking, each of the cancelled listings have immediately been relisted at higher prices and each of the hosts has tried to insist that I cancel the booking myself so they receive no fees.

Had we paid for this booking, we would have been forced to pay extra. I want to emphasize that we filled out the booking form correctly. However, when we contacted the host, he informed us that the listed price was irrelevant and that the actual cost was double. He then suggested we book directly through his own website.When I reported this to Airbnb, they simply thanked me for the information and sent me guidelines on how to book correctly. I already know the rules, which is why I reported the violation in the first place. It seems Airbnb doesn't care that their site hosts listings that violate their own policies, putting customers at risk.

The Crowdstrike IT outage downed so many planes that so many travelers had their plans canceled. Our plans got changed by the Airline at 5am on July 23. The host would not allow us to request a refund for the place after July 22 at 4pm. We got the text about 12hours later that our flights were changed and on top that there were no flights we could take as a back-up. We canceled so many plans and EVERY OTHER BUSINESS from car rentals to hotels all understood the situation and how unique it was and gave us refunds. These also were after the date that generally they would allow a refund, but again after explaining the situation EVERY ONE of the other business agreed this was unique. Joseph our gracious host however replied only twice despite me trying to explain our situation and ask is there anything he could work with us on. Even if he offered 50% refund that would have been a nice gesture. But no he refused and simple wrote to me the cancelation policy each time in a copy and paste method. I filled a formal complaint with Airbnb and they did nothing. They kept saying we can try other routes of obtaining you a refund. I asked what were those routes and each time was given a run around about how we can review those methods if the host refuses. Well he refuses and Airbnb simply said we tried everything. I now realize that anyone who went through what we experienced was unable to review Joseph as you are not allowed to tell others of your experience when this happens. There is no method.

While there, the guests refused to answer managements calls and texts about these things . . . because they didn't want to get busted breaking the rules.Then they left a nasty review which detailed things that did not happen (actually, a couple of things that literally could not have happened).  Upon investigation of his other hosts, this renter has done the exact same thing at other houses, and several times within in the last year alone:  he breaks rules, smokes, has pets, trashes the house top to bottom, then leaves inaccurate and negative reviews so he can get his money back.   He said in his review that he attempted to contact Airbnb about his ""issue"" but they never returned his calls or messages; Airbnb says they don't have records of this.  And, even though he stated in his review that he stayed much longer than he did (and therefore supposedly was ignored and inconvenienced for a long time) and Airbnb's facts, again, state otherwise, his review is allowed to stand despite obvious lies.Airbnb says that despite the guest's written history of his exact same continuing BAD behavior, they can't prove he did anything wrong or that his review is inaccurate or inflammatory. Airbnb won't take the many hosts' many words for it.  So the hosts lose their rental money, don't get their deposit for the damages, we personally got our first bad review ever, and Airbnb does nothing to stop this guest from robbing their hosts over and over again.And like others here, more than once as a guest I arrived at one of their rental properties only to find out the host had canceled last minute, or it was a fraudulent listing, and Airbnb did ZERO.

Airbnb defends their host's right to cancel us, if he sees a better business opportunity with other customers, but does not offer to cover the extra costs we now have to endure as a consequence of this 'freesom'. Instead, they suggest  'booking in a different and cheaper town' or wait another 24-48 hours and see if something cheaper turns up on our destination (so till the day before we arrive with our young son). In short, Airbnb has no interest to take any responsibility for an issue created by one of its hosts, and would rather leave a family with a small child on the street, which has made me feel really unsafe reg.

Had damp towels that were worn thin and you only had one towel each to use. No extra linen, pillows and very poor quality bedding. Furniture was so cheap and inexpensive quality that felt it would break if you moved it. Cheap shower gel and no shampoos etc to use. Big issue she had no hairdryer and and when asked she was so damn rude and cheeky about this. Wish I had cancelled and air b&b lie about these reviews.

Why not have the first page with the closest properties and then subsequent pages move further away?

When we got to the location the apartment was nothing like advertisement, the 3rd room was a space in the living room separated by a bookshelf, the shower curtain was torn and dirty, the bath tub was so messy it had morass growing on it, the entrance mat was caked with dirt and parts of the floor had thick dirt sitting on it.I called Airbnb and complained, after driving for 9 hours they told me all they could do was refund me my fee paid and $100 coupon to help me to book somewhere else, note this was a Friday evening, they themselves couldn’t find anywhere at last minute offering 3 rooms for the rate I paid plus $100 coupon.  They offered to increase the coupon to $200 when they themselves couldn’t rebook our reservation with any other host and me complaining and fussing with them for at least 3 hours after arrival.Accepting the $200 coupon and receiving the reimbursement fee would mean we still had to pay $500 USD in order to secure somewhere to sleep.  After going back and forth with customer service support up to 1:30am Saturday morning still no resolution because they decided they cannot assist further.At 2:30am they cancelled the booked reservation still with no resolution to our accommodation, approximately 7am I called them again to find out how do we move forward, they again offered a $200 coupon this time since they had cancelled the reservation this was to be used towards further booking, I told them I will never be booking with them ever again and they were like “ok but we can’t compensate the $200 no other way.That was the end, so with all the trouble we went through all was received from Airbnb support was a cancelled reservation and my money returned they didn’t care where we slept, or how we managed throughout the night after trusting booking through these people.IF YOU DON’T MIND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH NO ASSISTANCE WHEN YOU TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME TOWN/ COUNTRY NO HELP IF YOU GET STRANDED, POSSIBLE FILTHY ACCOMMODATIONS, STRESSFUL NIGHTS BECAUSE OF MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT AND NO COMPENSATION FOR ALL YOU EXPERIENCE “BOOK WITH AIRBNB”",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

We needed the problem solved, not a paltry sum as a placater; £27.75 out of £1110.Also, stop with the pre-written auto responses. You have a score of 1.3 out of 5 on here of over 13,000 reviews.

Toiletries, we had the place booked for 6 day, But the host supplied enough toiletries for about a day and a half. After we ran out of toilet paper the host recommended we go by our own for a 6-day stay. We wrote a truthful review about the place which his photos do not accurately depict the reality of how the place was + we also noted what a terrible host He was, he would water down his soap containers, and when you ran out from using it, he would tell you to go buy your own. Needless to say, Airbnb refused to allow the review, stating it violated their review policy. Which was a lie. They use that excuse to make one of their apartments look good. Airbnb does not protect people like us. They are only it for the money and they will side with a host as long as they can keep making money off of them. Stay away from this company, they're rating system is totally false, factual reviews telling the truth are not allowed to be posted, which should be posted, and they deliberately keep them from being posted so they can continue lining their pockets from innocent victims who book places like this because of the reviews which aren't true!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1

Got partial refund but still paid over $900 for 1 night.Horribly unclean bedroom slider and patio that was full of cobwebs and insects that hadn't been cleaned for weeks.  Though the host had told me it had just been cleaned and that happens due to proximity to river. Found out that the maintenance person hadn’t been there for at least 2 weeks.  Pots and pans that were greasy and rusted and sink that was horribly rusted.Unsafe due to broken blinds that would not close in the main living area so outsiders could look in on the ground floor .  Master bed hard as a rock.  Couldn’t get hot water in bathtubs.Had to wait for over an hour for a maintenance person come over for what the host called an “emergency” to look at blinds and water issue.Was told that if I wanted to find someplace else to go ahead.  I did and subsequently cancelled.  When asked for a refund I got a partial but the host insisted on keeping the $250 cleaning deposit.  I fought that with Airbnb and they did end up refunding that.So I received a little over $1700 back from the 2700 paid.  Over $900 for 1 night.  I could have stayed at a resort on a beach for a weekend for that!Cancellation policy says if place is unclean or unsafe a full refund is allowed.  Been fighting that all week.  Not going to happen.AirBnB say that my concerns were minor and I should have contacted them before cancelling.Host has still refused to refund any more, including what she calls “emergency “ call out.

1964,Not Recommended - Do Not Trust Them- ABNB is a Scam,"I agree with a lot of other reviews on here.  Their customer service is horrible and untrustworthy.  They say one thing and then transfer cases to someone else who decides what to do.I wrote an honest review for a host and gave the host 1 star and the review was removed.ABNB is a scam. Don’t stay in peoples homes. Take this seriously and always stay in a place where you can easily get your money back if you’re unsatisfied and leave. Their rules and policies cater towards the hosts and not guests. Guests are not their priority and are being taken advantage of. I think it is unacceptable that they require hosts to be paid in FULL before a trip without guests having the benefit of seeing a property and its condition. I rented a property in Baltimore, MD a month before a trip and did not see the entire property or the condition of the neighborhood. The property was in mediocre condition and the hosts were not cleaning properly and the home was in a very bad neighborhood. The grass was not mowed. The home was located in a neighborhood with boarded up houses, torn down buildings, trash left on the sidewalk, there was a lot of graffiti on buildings, and there are some homes with the windows blown out. The neighborhood was run down. This property should never have been permitted to be on ABNB. While there, I was harassed by the owner. So, I left the property and notified ABNB that I wanted a refund for the unused portion of my stay. The hosts refused to give me my money back for the remaining two weeks unless she / they could find someone else to rent. ABNB’s are NOT LEASED PROPERTIES and should not be treated as such. It is a mistake to require PAYMENT IN FULL before a guest sees the property. Hosts are able to get away with taking people’s money, treating people poorly, and not maintaining their property. In addition, ABNB charges a fee when you use their service. I don’t like their business model and think that they should require a deposit to rent the home and then payment in full is issued once a guest ends their stay. Don’t use ABNB.

I have to say that I am truly disappointed and feel insulted by the idea that I wrote that kind of review about the host and his deceptive add about the “condo.” The fact that the host asked to pay more for another person is fine, what is unethical is that I didn't receive anything extra.
